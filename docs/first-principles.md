# Flux Simulation Project: First Principles

---

### First of all, why "Flux"?

The name "Flux" was chosen to encapsulate the core essence of the world we are building. It speaks to the fundamental principle that our world is not static but in a constant state of **change over time**. This dynamism is central to our vision of a living, breathing environment where weather patterns shift, seasons turn, political landscapes evolve, and the consequences of actions ripple across the fabric of reality. As such, the world is not merely a backdrop for the player; it is in a constant state of becoming, shaped by the interactions and decisions of its inhabitants, and in doing so, becomes an active participant in the player's imagination.

Beyond mere change, "Flux" also conveys a sense of **ephemerality**. Moments, conditions, and even the immediate impact of events are often transient, contributing to the ongoing flow of the world's history. While the past shapes the present, the specific circumstances are fleeting, adding a layer of realism and natural evolution. Fleeting moments like these are precious, and they are what we want to capture in our world. They are the moments that players will remember and cherish.

## Our First Principles

Flux is a return to the kind of worlds that once made us fall in love with games. The kind of game that we'd obsess over
while lying in bed at night, dreaming about the next adventure. The kind of game that we'd play for years, and remember
for decades.

These are our first principles. They are not negotiable.

### 1. A Living, Breathing World

* The world is not static. It evolves with or without the player.
* Time, weather, seasons, politics, and memory shape the environment over days, weeks, years.
* Players have a direct, meaningful impact on the world.

### 2. Stewardship Over Ownership

* We are stewards, not owners, of the game world.
* Every change honors the integrity and continuity of the game.
* The health of the world matters more than short-term metrics.

### 4. Discovery and Emergent Gameplay

* Emergent play is more emotionally engaging than scripted experiences.
* A few well-designed primitives create infinite expression.

### 5. Fairness

* Our world is designed to provide equitable opportunities for all players.
* Progression is based on effort and engagement, not pay-to-win mechanics.
* Systems are transparent and predictable, minimizing arbitrary advantages.
* We strive to create a level playing field where skill and creativity are rewarded.

### 6. Monetization

* Monetization is a side effect — a reward — for good stewardship of a living world that players cherish deeply.
* We don’t cater to whales. In a healthy game world, whales don't exist.

### 7. Immersion

* The mind's eye is the most powerful "visualization" engine ever created.
* In a narrative-driven world, numbers are a distraction from immersion.
* We prioritize vivid storytelling, not stat sheets.
* But for those who want to peek under the hood — the numbers are always there, and they are always correct.

### 8. Be Good At What You Want
* Surface interactions remain intuitive and effortless.
* Deeper mastery is always possible for those who seek it, without forcing grind or busywork.
* There is no notion of character classes. Players are free to be good at whatever they want.

### 9. World Memory and Continuity

* The world remembers past events.
* Player actions, world events, and historical decisions persist and influence future developments.
* Unique artifacts and creations carry their own histories, with origins, ownership, and major events permanently recorded and discoverable by players.

### 10. Coherence

* The magic of the world comes from how deeply everything fits together.
* Systems are not scattered features — they are expressions of the same underlying truths.
* The rules are discoverable, consistent, and shared across domains.
* The world behaves predictably enough to be trusted — and richly enough to be surprising.
* There are no exceptions, no contradictions, no forgotten corners. Only a deep, resonant logic waiting to be uncovered.

### 11. Systems With Purpose

* Every system exists for a reason.
* If it doesn’t meaningfully enhance the player’s experience, it doesn’t belong.
* Nothing is added for metrics, churn, or filler.

### 12. Respect for the Player’s Time

* Players make meaningful progress in short sessions.
* Long-term commitment is always rewarded — never required.

### 13. Trust

* Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose. Once lost, it's not the same.
* Systems and rules remain visible and understandable.
* There are no dark patterns. No manipulation.

### 14. Tradition and Innovation

* We honor the deep tradition of MUDs by supporting full Xterm emulation in the game client.
* This is more than nostalgia — it’s a commitment to expressive power, precision input, and accessibility across devices.
* Our text interface is a canvas, not a constraint.

### 15. A Home for the Imagination

* This is a world players want to live in, dream about, and care for.
* We design for the mind’s eye, not the attention span.
