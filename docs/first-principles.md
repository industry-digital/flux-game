# Flux Simulation Project: First Principles

---

### First of all, why "Flux"?

The name "Flux" represents the fundamental nature of the world we are building—a system in constant motion, where **change is the only constant**. This is not a static backdrop for player actions, but a dynamic environment where weather patterns shift, seasons turn, political landscapes evolve, and the consequences of actions ripple outward through interconnected systems. The world itself becomes an active participant in every player's story, continuously evolving and responding to the choices made within it.

"Flux" also captures the **ephemeral nature of moments**. In our world, conditions are temporary, circumstances fleeting, and opportunities transient. Like the brief perfect conditions for a harvest or the narrow window when a diplomatic solution is possible, these moments exist briefly before giving way to new conditions. These fleeting instances—rare, meaningful, and unrepeatable—create the memorable experiences that players will carry with them.

## Our First Principles

Flux is our attempt to build the kind of world that once captured our imagination completely. The kind of game that would occupy our thoughts during quiet moments, where we'd wonder what was happening while we were away. The kind of world we'd return to again and again, not out of obligation, but because we genuinely wanted to see what happened next.

These are our first principles. They are not negotiable.

### 1. A Living, Breathing World

* The world operates as a complex system that remains interesting even without human players.
* Time moves forward continuously, carrying weather, seasons, politics, and historical memory through days, weeks, and years.
* Players have meaningful agency to influence and shape the world's development.

### 2. Discovery and Emergent Gameplay

* The most compelling stories emerge from the unexpected interactions between simple, well-designed systems.
* A handful of simple, well-designed primitives give rise to a vast possibility space.
* Wonder lives in the space between intention and outcome.

### 3. Trust

* Trust is difficult to earn and easy to lose. Once lost, it is gone forever.
* We operate without hidden mechanics, manipulation, or deception.

### 4. Stewardship Over Ownership

* We are caretakers of the game world, not its owners.
* Every decision must honor the integrity and long-term health of the world.
* The world's well-being takes precedence over short-term metrics or immediate profits.

### 5. Monetization

* Monetization is a reward -- a side effect -- of good stewardship over a world that players cherish deeply.
* We build for explorers and creators, not collectors and spenders. In healthy game worlds, whales simply don't exist.

### 6. Fairness

* All players enter the world on equal footing, with only their curiosity and determination.
* Progress comes from engagement and effort, never from financial advantage.
* Systems remain transparent and predictable—mystery belongs in outcomes, not in rules.
* Engagement and dedication are the primary paths to advancement.

### 7. Immersion

* The mind's eye is the most powerful visualization engine ever created. We design for the mind's eye, not for spreadsheets or optimization guides.
* Numbers serve the narrative, never the reverse. But for those who want to understand the mechanics, every calculation is mathematically precise and discoverable.

### 8. World Memory and Continuity

* The world remembers everything—every choice creates lasting consequences.
* Actions, events, and decisions become permanent parts of the world's history.
* Objects and artifacts carry their own histories: who made them, who used them, what events they witnessed.
* The past informs the present but never constrains future possibilities.

### 9. Coherence

* The world's power comes from how deeply its systems interconnect and reinforce each other.
* Features are not isolated additions—they are expressions of the same underlying principles.
* Rules emerge from consistent natural laws that apply across all domains.
* The world behaves predictably enough to be trusted, yet richly enough to surprise.
* There are no exceptions, contradictions, or forgotten edge cases—only deeper patterns waiting to be discovered.
* The rules of our simulation are publicly available for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to it.

### 10. Respect for the Player's Time

* Every system exists for a clear purpose that enhances the player experience. Features that serve no meaningful function have no place in our world.
* Players can make meaningful progress in brief sessions.
* Long-term engagement is rewarded but never required.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

These principles aren't just philosophy—they create specific, memorable experiences that emerge naturally from the world's systems. Here are some examples of what you might actually encounter:

### Example 1: The Butterfly Meadow

You're traveling through a meadow on a warm spring day when something unexpected begins to unfold:

```
> A butterfly (#945) arrived.
> A butterfly (#946) arrived.
> A butterfly flits onto a bed of flowers.
> A butterfly (#947) arrived.
> A butterfly (#948) arrived.
> A butterfly (#949) arrived.
> Several butterflies dance together in the warm sunlight.
> A butterfly (#950) arrived.
> A butterfly (#951) arrived.
> A butterfly (#952) arrived.
> A butterfly alights on your shoulder briefly before fluttering away.
> A butterfly (#953) arrived.
> A butterfly (#954) arrived.
> A butterfly (#955) arrived.
> A butterfly (#956) arrived.
> A butterfly (#957) arrived.
> A butterfly (#958) arrived.
> The meadow now swarms with colorful butterflies.
```

This magical moment emerged from the intersection of multiple systems:
- **Weather systems** created ideal temperature and sunlight conditions
- **Resource systems** responded with abundant nectar production in the flowers
- **Individual butterflies** made autonomous migration decisions based on their needs
- **Collective behaviors** emerged as butterflies detected others and began swarming
- **Random interactions** created a personal moment when one landed on your shoulder

**No script orchestrated this sequence.** No designer decided "time for a butterfly experience." It happened because autonomous systems created the conditions for it to happen naturally.

This is what we mean by emergent gameplay—the world creates its own stories.

### Example 2: The Bomber Goblin Incident

You're exploring an abandoned mine when you encounter a pack of bomber goblins—nasty creatures that carry explosive grenades in both hands. You decide to pick them off with your bow from a safe distance. Your first arrow finds its mark, striking the lead goblin's right hand. The damage is severe enough to destroy the hand completely, and the goblin involuntarily drops its grenade...

```
> Your arrow strikes the bomber goblin's right hand! (78 damage)
> The bomber goblin's right hand is destroyed!
> The bomber goblin drops a grenade.
> A grenade will detonate in 6 seconds.

> The bomber goblin pack begins to scatter in panic.

> The grenade detonates! (explosive damage to area)
> The bomber goblin takes 45 explosive damage to left hand!
> The bomber goblin takes 52 explosive damage to right hand!
> The bomber goblin's left hand is destroyed!
> The bomber goblin's right hand is destroyed!
> The bomber goblin drops a grenade.
> The bomber goblin drops a grenade.
> Two grenades will detonate in 6 seconds.

> Another bomber goblin takes 38 explosive damage to right hand!
> The bomber goblin's right hand is destroyed!
> The bomber goblin drops a grenade.
> A grenade will detonate in 6 seconds.
```

This absurd catastrophe emerged from the intersection of just three simple rules:
- **Explosive items detonate 6 seconds after being dropped**
- **Hands destroyed by explosive damage drop whatever they're holding**
- **Bomber goblins carry grenades in both hands**

**No designer programmed a "chain reaction sequence."** The hilarious goblin self-destruction emerged naturally from the logical interaction of basic game rules. Your single arrow created a cascading failure that the goblins' own biology and equipment turned into their doom.
