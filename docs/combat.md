# Flux Combat System Brief

## Core Philosophy
Combat in Flux is **time-based, skill-expressive, and tactically deep**. Every action has a time cost, and mastery means doing more within the same constraints. Combat feels grounded in reality while rewarding genuine skill development.

## Foundation: Time-Based Action Economy
- **6-second combat rounds** where all combatants act in initiative order
- **Every action has a time cost** (fractional seconds allowed: 1.2s, 2.7s, etc.)
- **Skill mastery reduces time costs** - masters get more actions per round
- **Multi-round abilities** for powerful actions requiring 6+ seconds to complete

## Combat Grammar
Simple but expressive command vocabulary:
- `AIM <target>` - Variable time based on weapon skill, improves accuracy
- `ATTACK <target>` - Immediate attack without aiming
- `STANCE ADOPT <name>` - Switch to pre-configured defensive posture
- **Any non-combat action works too** - `HIDE`, `CLIMB`, `SEARCH`, etc.

## Stance System
- `STANCE CREATE <name> <block> <parry> <evade>` - Players design custom defensive allocations
- `STANCE ADOPT <name>` - Switch stances with skill-based time costs
- Creates personalized tactical signatures and specialized builds

## Combat Initiation: KOS Marking
- **PvP requires opt-in** - Players toggle PvP flag for 7-day commitment periods
- **KOS Marking** - Players can mark others as "kill on sight"
- **Auto-engagement** - When marked players meet and are mutually aware, combat begins
- **Stealth interactions** - Hidden players can avoid auto-engagement or gain surprise bonuses

## Stealth & Surprise Attacks
### Three Stealth Skills
- **Hiding** (AGI) - Remaining concealed in position
- **Sneaking** (AGI) - Silent movement without detection
- **Trickery** (INT/WIS) - Misdirection, disguise, and deception

### Stealth Detection
- When both players are hidden, mutual **Perception vs. Stealth** skill checks determine who spots whom first
- Detection failure allows continued stealth positioning and tactical advantage

### Surprise Attack Mechanics
- **Stealth approach** - Attacker can close to melee range undetected
- **Initiative bonus** - Surprise attacks grant massive initiative advantage
- **Combat sequence** - Surprised victim may face both the initial attack AND a full combat round before they can respond
- **Risk/reward** - Stealth investment pays off with potentially decisive opening advantage

## Group Dynamics & Escalation
- **Group involvement** - Marking someone pulls their entire group into combat
- **Natural escalation** - Solo conflicts pressure players to recruit allies
- **Political warfare** - Personal disputes evolve into factional conflicts
- **24-hour cooldowns** on re-marking prevent harassment

## Combat Roles & Range Dynamics

### Spellcasters
- **Distant range specialists** - powerful but vulnerable artillery role
- **Multi-round casting** - most powerful abilities require channeling across multiple rounds
- **Team coordination required** - allies must protect vulnerable casters during long casts

### Ranged Fighters
- **Range optimization** - different weapons excel at different distances (reach vs. distant)
- **Falloff accuracy** - weapons become less accurate outside their optimal range
- **Reach skirmishers** - high damage potential but operate in dangerous middle distance
- **Evasion dependency** - mobility skills crucial for maintaining optimal positioning

### Range Categories
- **Melee** - Close combat, immediate threat
- **Reach** - Middle distance, mobile skirmisher zone
- **Distant** - Long range, sniper territory

## Skill Integration
- **Action economy scales with skill** - Better fighters do more per round
- **Weapon specialization** - Different weapons have different time cost curves
- **Cross-system synergy** - All character skills (stealth, social, etc.) remain available in combat
- **Evasion for range control** - Mobility skills help maintain optimal positioning and distance

## Key Design Principles
1. **Skill expression through time efficiency** - Mastery is visible and impactful
2. **Meaningful commitment** - PvP decisions have lasting consequences
3. **Emergent complexity** - Simple rules create deep tactical possibilities
4. **Grounded realism** - Time costs make combat feel physically plausible
5. **Social integration** - Combat connects to broader world politics and relationships

The result: Combat that rewards both mechanical skill and strategic thinking, where conflicts feel meaningful and victories are genuinely earned.
