# Flux Combat System: Physics-Based Tactical Combat
>>>>>>> 31f060a (Actor combat physics)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Combat System is a physics-based, tactical combat system designed for a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) that emphasizes skill and understanding of real-world physical principles. Combat follows a **turn-based structure** similar to Divinity: Original Sin 2, where each actor takes sequential turns with a full Action Point pool to spend during their activation.
=======
## Synopsis

### Linear Battlefield Arena
Combat takes place on a **300-meter linear battlefield** with combatants starting 100 meters apart at rest. The arena consists of a central 100m combat zone flanked by 100m safety margins on each side, creating focused tactical engagements where positioning and distance management are paramount.

### Physics-Driven Combat
Every action is governed by authentic physics principles. **Power (POW)** determines kinetic energy generation through a linear 3-second spool-up curve, **Grace (GRA)** controls movement and momentum generation, and **Resilience (RES)** manages energy reserves and recovery. Damage results from muscular force and momentum transfer, modified by weapon efficiency tiers following golden ratio progression (0.382×, 0.618×, 1.000×, 1.618×).

### Tactical Depth Through Mathematics
Combat rewards understanding of power spool-up mechanics, kinetic energy ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$), momentum transfer efficiency, and energy management. Flat armor reduction favors devastating single strikes over rapid combinations, while motion-based hit difficulty creates natural counterplay. Players gain competitive advantage through physics literacy rather than memorizing arbitrary damage tables.

### Build Diversity and Tactical Triangle
- **Heavy Armor + Low Mobility**: Breakthrough specialists immune to chip damage but vulnerable to momentum-based attacks
- **High Grace + Light Armor**: Anti-armor specialists generating massive momentum damage but vulnerable to sustained combinations
- **Balanced Builds**: Versatile combatants with tactical flexibility to adapt based on opponent weaknesses
- **Power specialists**: Focus on devastating single strikes through superior energy generation and weapon efficiency

## Action Points: Temporal Combat Economy

### Action Point Fundamentals

Combat operates on an **Action Point (AP) system** where time becomes a strategic resource. Every combat action has a temporal cost measured in Action Points, creating tactical decisions about timing and resource allocation.

**Base Action Economy:**
- **Default AP Pool**: 6.0 Action Points
- **Time Scale**: 1 AP = 1 second of world time
- **Precision**: 0.1 AP (0.1 second) minimum increment
- **Base Action Economy**: 6.0 AP over 6 world seconds (100% baseline)

**Universal Action Cost Principle:**
All combat actions consume Action Points - from simple strikes to complex tactical maneuvers. No action is free, and every decision has temporal consequences.

### Fractional Action Point System

**Granular Precision:**
- **Minimum Increment**: 0.1 AP represents the threshold of player-noticeable timing differences
- **Fractional Costs**: Actions can cost precise amounts like 1.3 AP, 2.7 AP, or 0.8 AP
- **Smooth Progression**: Skills reduce AP costs incrementally rather than in dramatic jumps

**Example Action Costs:**
```
Novice Swordsman:    Sword strike costs 2.5 AP
Trained Swordsman:   Same strike costs 2.2 AP
Expert Swordsman:    Same strike costs 1.8 AP
Master Swordsman:    Same strike costs 1.3 AP
```

### Action Economy Scaling

**Enhanced Action Economy Examples:**
- **9.0 AP over 6 seconds**: 150% action economy (50% improvement)
- **4.5 AP over 6 seconds**: 75% action economy (25% reduction)
- **7.2 AP over 6 seconds**: 120% action economy (20% improvement)

Action economy directly translates to **combat tempo advantage** - actors with higher effective AP can perform more actions within the same timeframe, creating significant tactical superiority.

### Skill-Based Action Efficiency

**Every Action Links to a Skill:**
All combat actions are governed by specific learnable skills. Higher skill proficiency reduces the AP cost of related actions, creating meaningful character progression and specialization opportunities.

**Skill Categories and AP Reduction:**
- **Weapon Skills**: Reduce AP costs for weapon-specific attacks and techniques
- **Athletics**: Decrease movement and positioning action costs
- **Combat Awareness**: Lower AP costs for defensive actions and reactions
- **Tactical Skills**: Reduce costs for complex battlefield maneuvers

**Micro-Optimization Benefits:**
Small skill improvements compound over multiple actions. A character saving 0.2 AP per action gains significant tempo advantage over extended combat encounters.

### Improving Action Economy

Players can enhance their action economy through two primary methods:

**1. Increasing AP Pool Size**
- Larger AP pools enable more actions per combat round
- Provides tactical flexibility for complex action sequences
- Allows sustained high-tempo combat engagement
- Achieved through gear, augmentations, or character advancement

**2. Reducing AP Costs (Skill-Based)**
- Skills reduce the temporal overhead of specific action types
- Expertise enables efficient execution of complex techniques
- Specialization creates action economy advantages in focused combat areas
- Smooth progression allows incremental optimization

### Tactical Implications

**High AP Pool Actors:**
- Execute multiple actions while opponents are limited to fewer
- Maintain combat initiative through superior action economy
- Capable of complex tactical combinations within single rounds

**High Skill Actors:**
- Perform actions with exceptional efficiency
- Can fit more actions into standard AP pools through reduced costs
- Demonstrate mastery through precise timing and execution

**Action Chaining Examples:**
```
Efficient Combatant: Move (1.2 AP) + Strike (1.8 AP) + Block (1.5 AP) = 4.5 AP total
Leaves 1.5 AP for reactive actions or partial next-turn preparation

Standard Combatant: Move (1.8 AP) + Strike (2.5 AP) + Block (2.0 AP) = 6.3 AP total
Exceeds standard pool, requires action prioritization
```

**Action Point Strategy:**
- **Burst tactics**: Expend full AP pool for maximum immediate impact
- **Sustained combat**: Manage AP expenditure for prolonged engagements
- **Precision timing**: Leverage fractional AP for exact tactical sequences
- **Skill investment**: Balance AP pool increases with skill development for optimal efficiency

## Core Philosophy
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

## Turn-Based Combat Structure

Combat proceeds in a strict turn-based sequence with the following phases:

1. **Initiative Phase**: Determine turn order based on character Finesse (FIN) and other modifiers
2. **Actor Turn**: The active actor receives their full 6.0 AP pool to spend on actions
3. **Action Resolution**: Actions execute immediately upon selection, though complex actions may have duration effects
4. **Turn Transition**: Energy recovery, status effects, and environmental changes apply between turns
5. **Round Completion**: Initiative advances to the next actor in sequence

**Key Mechanic**: While individual actions (such as strike charging) may take real-world time to build up power, no other actors can act until the current actor's turn is complete. This creates real-time physics tension within the strategic framework of turn-based combat.

### Turn Boundaries

A turn ends when the actor either:
- Spends all available AP on actions
- Chooses to end turn early (converting remaining AP to defensive bonuses via `DEFEND`)
- Executes an action that consumes their remaining AP

**Energy Recovery**: The golden ratio energy recovery curve operates between turns, allowing actors to regain capacitor energy during other players' turns.

## Core Mechanics and Character Attributes

All combat is driven by three core character stats that govern the physical capabilities of a character: Power (POW), Finesse (FIN), and Resilience (RES).

**Power (POW)**: A character's ability to generate kinetic energy through muscular force. High POW enables faster acceleration and more efficient energy transfer into strikes. A character's natural power output ($P_{natural}$) is calculated as $(POW \times 25W) + 125W$.

**Finesse (FIN)**: Governs a character's relationship with movement and inertia. High FIN increases top speed and reduces effective mass, leading to faster acceleration and better body control while moving. FIN also influences initiative order in turn-based combat.

**Resilience (RES)**: Defines a character's energy reserves and recovery capabilities. Like a biological capacitor, RES determines how much energy an actor can store and how quickly they can replenish it between turns.

These stats form a Tactical Triangle, creating distinct character builds:

- **Speed Builds (High FIN, Moderate POW)**: Fast and agile, they generate massive momentum damage by using velocity squared ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$). They are specialists in hit-and-run tactics and typically act early in initiative order.

- **Strength Builds (High POW, Moderate FIN)**: Strong but slower, they rely on superior energy transfer and weapon efficiency to deal devastating single strikes.

- **Endurance Builds (High RES)**: They can sustain performance over long engagements, becoming relatively stronger as their opponents fatigue. Their superior energy recovery between turns provides increasing advantage in extended combats.

## The Battlefield and Action Point System

Combat occurs on a 300-meter linear battlefield. When two opposing actors enter combat, they are placed at opposite ends of the battlefield, 100 meters apart. On both sides of this 100m gap is a margin of 100 meters, yielding a total of 300 meters of battlefield.

**Power Output Scaling:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
```
Linear Battlefield Layout (300m total):

[Margin]    [Combat Zone]    [Margin]
  100m         100m           100m
    |            |             |
    v            v             v

0m -------- 100m -------- 200m -------- 300m
|            |             |            |
|            A             B            |
|         Actor 1       Actor 2         |
|                                       |
West                                   East
Boundary                           Boundary

Initial Positions:
• Actor 1: 100m ("west" edge of combat zone)
• Actor 2: 200m ("east" edge of combat zone)
• Distance apart: 100m
• Available movement: 0m-300m total battlefield
```
=======
$$P_{output} = (POW \times 25W) + 125W$$

Where:
- POW 10: $P_{output} = 375W$ (ordinary human)
- POW 50: $P_{output} = 1,375W$ (strong human)
- POW 100: $P_{output} = 2,625W$ (superhuman)
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

We use "east" and "west" figuratively here, and not in the literal sense.

### Collision Mechanics

<<<<<<< HEAD
First, let's agree on what "collision" means.

Collision is defined as a situation where one actor's body intersects at the same point in space as another actor's body.
=======
**Grace Scaling:**
$$v_{max} = 2 + \max(GRA \times 0.25, 5) \text{ m/s}$$
$$m_{eff} = m_{natural} \times (1 - I_{reduction})$$
$$I_{reduction} = \frac{(GRA - 10) \times 0.618}{90} \text{ for } GRA > 10$$

### The Power-Grace-Resilience Triangle
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

Actor bodies on the linear battlefield -- by default -- do not collide with anything. Collision happens only under these specific circumstances:

1. Actor `TARGET`s another actor, issues a `APPROACH 0` command. This is a "ramming" maneuver.
2. Actor `APPROACH`es another actor, and the target actor `APPROACH`es the actor.

In both cases, the actor that is being approached is considered the "target" and the actor that is approaching is considered the "attacker".

It is assumed that a melee attack has a range of 1 meter.
A *reach* attack, using a reach weapon like a spear, has a range of 2 meters.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Action Point System
=======
$$\begin{align}
\text{Unarmed Combat:} \quad &\eta = 0.382 = \varphi^{-2} \\
\text{Light Weapons:} \quad &\eta = 0.618 = \varphi^{-1} \\
\text{Medium Weapons:} \quad &\eta = 1.000 \text{ (baseline)} \\
\text{Heavy Weapons:} \quad &\eta = 1.618 = \varphi
\end{align}$$
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

The combat economy is managed by an Action Point (AP) system, where time becomes a strategic resource within each turn.

- **AP Pool**: Actors have a default pool of 6.0 AP per turn, representing 6 seconds of focused action time. This is their "action economy" for a single turn.

- **Action Costs**: All actions, from strikes to movement and even actions like taking things out of a container, have a temporal cost in AP. The minimum increment is 0.1 AP, allowing for precise tactical sequencing within a turn.

- **Skill-Based Efficiency**: Higher skill proficiency in a specific action reduces its AP cost, providing a clear path for character progression and specialization. This creates a combat tempo advantage for skilled players, who can perform more actions within the same turn.

- **Turn-Based Refresh**: Unlike real-time systems, AP pools refresh to full at the beginning of each actor's turn, regardless of how much was spent previously.

- **Improving Economy**: Players can increase their action economy by either increasing their AP pool size through gear and advancements or by reducing AP costs through skill development.

## Damage and Weapon Mechanics

Damage is a product of both muscular force and momentum transfer. The final damage is a combination of these two sources, scaled by a weapon's efficiency and reduced by armor.

$$D_{final} = \max\left(0, \frac{(D_{muscular} + D_{momentum}) \times \eta_{weapon}}{5J} - A_{value}\right)$$

- **Muscular Damage ($D_{muscular}$)**: This is the damage generated from the character's muscular effort, calculated as $P_{effective} \times t_{strike} / 5J$.

- **Momentum Damage ($D_{momentum}$)**: This is the damage from a character's kinetic energy in motion, calculated as $(\frac{1}{2}mv^2) \times (POW/100) / 5J$. The Power (POW) stat determines how effectively this momentum is transferred.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Weapon Efficiency ($\eta_{weapon}$)**: Weapons follow a golden ratio progression ($\phi$) in efficiency, which determines how effectively kinetic energy is transferred into damage.

  - **Unarmed**: $0.382 \times \eta$ ($\phi^{-2}$)
  - **Light Weapons**: $0.618 \times \eta$ ($\phi^{-1}$)
  - **Medium Weapons**: $1.000 \times \eta$ (Baseline)
  - **Heavy Weapons**: $1.618 \times \eta$ ($\phi$)
=======
$$D_{total} = (D_{muscular} + D_{momentum}) \times \eta_{weapon}$$

Where:
$$D_{muscular} = \frac{P_{output} \times t_{strike}}{5J}$$
$$D_{momentum} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \times \eta_{POW}}{5J}$$
$$\eta_{POW} = \frac{POW}{100}$$
$$\eta_{weapon} \in \{0.382, 0.618, 1.000, 1.618\}$$
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

It stands to reason that it's easier to kill someone with a heavy weapon than with fists, even though the power expenditure of the actor is the same. Thus we introduce this artificial "efficiency" coefficient.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Dual-wielding light weapons provides a total efficiency of $1.236 \times \eta$, placing it between medium and heavy weapons in power.
=======
**POW determines how effectively you transfer momentum** from movement into strikes:
$$\eta_{POW} = \frac{POW}{100}$$

Examples:
- POW 10: $\eta_{POW} = 0.10$ (90% energy lost to poor form)
- POW 50: $\eta_{POW} = 0.50$ (balanced technique)
- POW 100: $\eta_{POW} = 1.00$ (perfect energy transfer)

This reflects the reality that **strength affects technique** - stronger actors maintain better form under dynamic conditions, transferring kinetic energy more effectively.
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

## Resilience and Energy Management

Whenever we refer to an actor's energy reserves, we use the term "capacitor".

The Resilience (RES) stat directly affects an actor's capacitor in two key ways:

1. Larger energy pool (Joules)
2. Faster recovery rate as a secondary consequence of having a larger energy pool

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Between-Turn Recovery**: Energy recovery occurs during other actors' turns, not during the active actor's turn. This creates strategic timing where actors with high RES become relatively stronger in longer combats.
=======
$$E_{capacity} = RES \times 100J$$
$$R_{max} = RES \times 10W$$
$$E_{current} = \text{Available energy for power output}$$
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

- **Golden Ratio Recovery Curve**: The energy recovery rate is not constant; it follows a curve that peaks at 38.2% of a character's maximum energy capacity. This "golden zone" encourages players to maintain a state of moderate energy depletion, as recovery is agonizingly slow from complete exhaustion and inefficient when an energy pool is nearly full.

- **Fatigue-Limited Power**: A character's effective power output diminishes as their energy reserves deplete. This means sustained, high-power actions are not possible without adequate recovery, creating a natural trade-off between burst damage and endurance within and across turns.

## Defensive Maneuvers

<<<<<<< HEAD
Defensive maneuvers are of three categories:
=======
$$t = \frac{E_{current}}{E_{capacity}} \in [0, 1]$$
$$\text{Peak recovery occurs at } t = 0.382 = \varphi^{-1}$$
$$\text{Recovery approaches zero at } t = 0 \text{ and } t = 1$$
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

- **Dodging**: The actor moves out of the way of the attack. Dodging is affected by the actor's Finesse (FIN) stat.
- **Blocking**: The actor blocks the attack with a shield or other object. Blocking is affected by the actor's Resilience (RES) stat.
- **Parrying**: The actor parries the attack with a weapon. Parrying is affected by the actor's Finesse (FIN) stat.

Actors may at any time during their turn issue a `DEFEND` command. This causes the actor to *spend all remaining AP* for the current turn towards defensive bonuses. These bonuses take effect immediately and persist until the beginning of the actor's next turn. While these bonuses are in effect, the effectiveness of attacks directed toward the actor is reduced by the amount proportional to the square of the AP invested.

Whenever an actor successfully defends against an attack, a small amount of energy is deducted from the actor's capacitor, but never below a threshold of 38.2% of the actor's maximum capacitor.

## Tactical and Strategic Implications

The Flux Combat System creates a tactical "rock-paper-scissors" dynamic driven by physics, not arbitrary rules, within the strategic framework of turn-based combat.

- **Flat Armor Reduction**: Armor provides a fixed damage reduction per strike. This favors single, devastating haymakers over rapid, light combinations, making heavy armor builds a direct counter to speed builds.

- **Motion-Based Hit Difficulty**: Moving targets are harder to hit with momentum-based attacks. This creates an advantage for mobile, high-finesse characters against slow, heavy-hitting opponents.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Turn-Based Tactical Planning**: The turn structure allows players to carefully plan complex sequences of actions, such as building momentum over multiple movement actions before executing a devastating charge attack.
=======
$$POW_{effective} = \min(POW_{natural}, POW_{energy-limited})$$
$$\text{where } POW_{energy-limited} = \frac{E_{current}}{t_{strike}}$$
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)

- **Execution Uncertainty**: While damage calculations are deterministic, success is not guaranteed. A dice roll determines if a calculated hit connects, introducing a layer of uncertainty and skill-based execution. There are no "damage dice" or critical hits; instead, the player's understanding of physics and their ability to create the right conditions for a powerful strike is what leads to a "critical" outcome.

The result is a system where players with a deep understanding of the underlying physics—from calculating power-to-mass ratios to managing their energy in the golden recovery zone—gain a genuine, quantifiable competitive advantage within the strategic framework of turn-based planning.

## Appendices

### A. Numeric Integration Algorithm for Strike Power

The combat system uses **32-step Simpson's rule integration** to calculate total kinetic energy generated during variable-duration strikes. As an actor's energy capacitor depletes during extended attacks, their effective power output decreases, creating natural diminishing returns for long wind-ups.

**Integration Method:**
- **Algorithm**: Simpson's 1/3 rule for cubic accuracy
- **Steps**: 32 subdivisions for optimal performance/precision balance
- **Resolution**: ~0.094s per step (well below 0.1s AP threshold)
- **Purpose**: Calculate area under power curve = total kinetic energy

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function integrateStrikePower(duration, initialEnergy, naturalPower, naturalRES) {
  const n = 32; // Number of integration steps
  const h = duration / n; // Step size (~0.094s for 3-second strikes)
  const maxRecovery = naturalRES * 10; // Watts per RES point

  let currentEnergy = initialEnergy;
  let integral = 0;

  // Simpson's 1/3 rule: (h/3) * [f(x₀) + 4f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 4f(x₃) + ... + f(xₙ)]
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    const t = i * h;
    const remainingDuration = duration - t;

    // Energy-limited power output
    const energyLimitedPower = remainingDuration > 0 ?
      currentEnergy / remainingDuration : naturalPower;
    const effectivePower = Math.min(naturalPower, energyLimitedPower);

    // Simpson's coefficients: 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, ..., 4, 1
    const coefficient = (i === 0 || i === n) ? 1 : (i % 2 === 1) ? 4 : 2;
    integral += coefficient * effectivePower;

    // Update energy state for next step
    if (i < n) {
      // Energy depletion
      currentEnergy -= effectivePower * h;

      // Golden ratio recovery (peaks at 38.2% capacity)
      const energyRatio = currentEnergy / (naturalRES * 100);
      const recoveryRate = maxRecovery * goldenRecoveryCurve(energyRatio);
      currentEnergy += recoveryRate * h;

      // Clamp to valid range
      currentEnergy = Math.max(0, Math.min(currentEnergy, naturalRES * 100));
    }
  }

  return (h / 3) * integral; // Total kinetic energy generated
}

<<<<<<< HEAD
function goldenRecoveryCurve(t) {
  // Recovery rate is the first derivative of a phase-shifted sigmoid
  // Peaks at t = 0.382 (golden ratio conjugate)
  const shifted = t - 0.382; // Phase shift to peak at golden ratio
  return Math.exp(-50 * shifted * shifted); // Gaussian-like curve peaked at 0.382
=======
### Momentum Combat Example

**Mobile Fighter** (POW 30, GRA 60, Mass 80kg):
- **Approach Speed**: 17 m/s maximum
- **Raw Kinetic Energy**: 11,560J at full speed
- **Momentum Transfer**: 30% efficiency = 3,468J effective
- **Damage**: 694 points from movement alone

**Power Fighter** (POW 60, GRA 30, Mass 80kg):
- **Approach Speed**: 9.5 m/s maximum
- **Raw Kinetic Energy**: 3,610J at full speed
- **Momentum Transfer**: 60% efficiency = 2,166J effective
- **Damage**: 433 points from movement

**Tactical Conclusion**: Mobile fighters generate more raw kinetic energy through speed, while power fighters transfer energy more efficiently. Both approaches create viable combat effectiveness through different physics principles.

## Battlefield Structure: Linear Combat Arena

### Arena Layout and Dimensions

Combat in Flux takes place on a **linear battlefield** inspired by arcade-style fighting games like Street Fighter. This design creates focused, tactical engagements where positioning and movement become critical strategic elements.

**Battlefield Specifications:**
- **Total Length**: 300 meters
- **Combat Zone**: Central 100m where fighters start
- **Safety Margins**: 100m on each side for tactical maneuvering
- **Starting Positions**: Combatants begin 100m apart, at rest
- **Linear Movement**: All tactical positioning occurs along a single axis

```
[100m Margin] --- [100m Combat Zone] --- [100m Margin]
      ↑                    ↑                    ↑
   Left Edge        Starting Positions      Right Edge
```

### Strategic Implications of Linear Combat

**Positioning Constraints:**
- **No flanking maneuvers**: All movement is forward/backward along the axis
- **Range control is paramount**: Distance management becomes the primary tactical skill
- **Commitment to engagement**: Moving forward reduces escape options
- **Corner pressure**: Being pushed to battlefield edges limits tactical options

**Arena Control Dynamics:**
- **Center control**: Maintaining central position provides maximum tactical flexibility
- **Edge pressure**: Forcing opponents toward margins reduces their movement options
- **Momentum preservation**: Linear movement emphasizes acceleration and deceleration timing

## Distance and Gap-Closing Physics

### Integration-Based Movement

Movement uses **numerical integration** where $s = \int_0^t v(t') dt'$. Every meter traveled results from solving calculus in real-time:

```typescript
// Authentic physics integration
for (let t = 0; t < time; t += integrationStep) {
  const acceleration = powerOutput / effectiveMass;
  const velocity = Math.min(acceleration * t, topSpeed);
  const deltaDistance = velocity * integrationStep;
  totalDistance += deltaDistance;
>>>>>>> 3eef86e (Combat)
}
```

#### The Engagement Evolution
**Early Engagement**: Fresh power cores provide maximum tactical options - heavy builds can still reposition effectively
**Mid-Engagement**: Power degradation begins favoring lighter configurations as heavy builds lose mobility advantage
**Late Engagement**: Depleted power cores create dramatic capability gaps - heavy builds become increasingly static

### B. Strike Duration Efficiency Analysis: Power Spool-Up System

Players who grasp these power-mobility relationships gain genuine competitive advantage, making energy economics and physics literacy core combat skills rather than memorizing arbitrary movement rules.

### The Counter-Triangle: Shell Type Tactical Relationships

<<<<<<< HEAD
Where `t` is the cumulative time spent building power within a single strike during an actor's turn.

**Single 3-Second Haymaker (6.0 AP turn):**
```
High POW Fighter (POW 80, RES 80):
- Starting Energy: 8,000J
- Natural Power: 2,125W
- Turn Action: 3-second haymaker (costs 3.0 AP)
- Power ramp over 3 seconds:
  * t = 0-1s: 0% → 33% power (average 354W)
  * t = 1-2s: 33% → 67% power (average 1,063W)
  * t = 2-3s: 67% → 100% power (average 1,771W)
- Average Power: ~1,063W over 3 seconds
- Total Energy Generated: 3,188J
- Energy Cost: 3,188J depleted
- Remaining Energy: 4,812J (60.2% capacity)
- Remaining AP: 3.0 (available for movement, defense, etc.)
```
=======
**Mathematical Inevitability**: Physics creates natural tactical relationships where equipment choices determine engagement capabilities.

## Tactical Combat Applications

### Pre-Combat Positioning

**Light Actors** can afford aggressive positioning because they retain repositioning options through superior mobility.

**Heavy Actors** must choose initial positions carefully since relocation is costly and time-consuming.

### Dynamic Engagement Evolution

**Early Engagement**: All actors have maximum tactical options
**Mid Engagement**: Momentum damage becomes critical as actors close distance
**Late Engagement**: Weapon efficiency and POW scaling determine outcomes

### Build Counters Through Physics

**Speed Counters Strength**: Superior positioning and momentum damage
**Strength Counters Speed**: Perfect momentum transfer and weapon efficiency
**Balanced Builds**: Tactical flexibility to adapt to opponent strategies

These relationships emerge from **authentic physics** rather than artificial balance mechanics.

## Damage Types and Resistance

### Primary Damage Types

**Kinetic**: Physical force transfer (melee, bullets, arrows)
- Resisted by armor thickness and material properties
- Enhanced by momentum and weapon efficiency

**Thermal**: Heat-based damage (flames, plasma, lasers)
- Resisted by thermal insulation and heat dissipation
- Bypasses traditional armor through energy transfer

**Explosive**: Pressure wave damage (grenades, bombs, mines)
- Resisted by structural integrity and blast deflection
- Area effect with distance-based damage falloff

### Armor and Protection Physics

**Kinetic Protection**: Armor effectiveness follows impact physics
**Thermal Protection**: Heat dissipation and insulation mechanics
**Explosive Protection**: Pressure wave deflection and structural integrity

Protection systems operate through **physics simulation** rather than arbitrary damage reduction percentages.

## Mastery Through Physics Understanding

### Core Combat Skills

1. **Power Management**: Understanding POW scaling and kinetic energy generation
2. **Momentum Mastery**: Using velocity² scaling for massive damage multipliers
3. **Efficiency Optimization**: Choosing weapons that maximize energy transfer
4. **Physics Intuition**: Predicting combat outcomes through mathematical understanding

### Competitive Advantage

Players who understand the underlying physics gain **genuine competitive advantage**:
- **Better build optimization** through power-to-mass calculations
- **Superior tactical decisions** based on momentum transfer efficiency
- **Accurate damage prediction** using kinetic energy principles
- **Equipment synergy** leveraging golden ratio weapon progression

Combat mastery comes from **physics literacy** rather than memorizing arbitrary rules, creating depth that rewards understanding over memorization.

}
```

**Physical Meaning:**
- **Area under curve**: Total kinetic energy transferred to weapon
- **Declining power**: Reflects realistic energy depletion during sustained exertion
- **Natural balance**: Long wind-ups generate less total energy than rapid combinations
- **Computational efficiency**: 32 steps provide excellent accuracy with minimal overhead

**Tactical Implications:**
This integration naturally creates the desired balance where skilled fighters using rapid combinations out-perform brute force approaches, all emerging from authentic physics simulation rather than arbitrary game balance mechanics.

### B. Strike Duration Efficiency Analysis: Power Spool-Up System

The combat system uses a **3-second power spool-up mechanism** where actors must build up to maximum power output over time. This creates natural energy inefficiency for long wind-ups while maintaining the potential for devastating attacks.

**Power Spool-Up Formula:**
$$P_{effective}(t) = P_{natural} \times \min(1.0, \frac{t}{3.0})$$

Where `t` is the cumulative time spent building power within a single strike.

**The Power Ramp Dynamics:**

**Single 3-Second Haymaker:**
```
High POW Fighter (POW 80, RES 80):
- Starting Energy: 8,000J
- Natural Power: 2,125W
- Power ramp over 3 seconds:
  * t = 0-1s: 0% → 33% power (average 354W)
  * t = 1-2s: 33% → 67% power (average 1,063W)
  * t = 2-3s: 67% → 100% power (average 1,771W)
- Average Power: ~1,063W over 3 seconds
- Total Energy Generated: 3,188J
- Energy Cost: 3,188J depleted
- Remaining Energy: 4,812J (60.2% capacity)
```

**Three 1-Second Jabs with Recovery Analysis:**
```
Same Fighter, 3 separate 1-second strikes with spool-up mechanics:

Starting Energy: 8,000J

Jab 1 (0→1s spool-up):
- Power ramp: 0% → 33% (average 354W)
- Energy Generated: 354J
- Energy Cost: 354J depleted
- Remaining Energy: 7,646J (95.6% capacity)

Recovery Phase 1 (0.5s positioning):
- Recovery Rate: 800W × 1.0 efficiency (excellent zone) = 800W
- Energy Recovered: 800W × 0.5s = 400J
- Energy Before Jab 2: 8,000J (100% capacity - capped)

Jab 2 (0→1s spool-up):
- Power ramp: 0% → 33% (average 354W)
- Energy Generated: 354J
- Energy Cost: 354J depleted
- Remaining Energy: 7,646J (95.6% capacity)

Recovery Phase 2 (0.5s positioning):
- Recovery Rate: 800W × 1.0 efficiency = 800W
- Energy Recovered: 400J (capped at maximum)
- Energy Before Jab 3: 8,000J (100% capacity)

Jab 3 (0→1s spool-up):
- Power ramp: 0% → 33% (average 354W)
- Energy Generated: 354J
- Energy Cost: 354J depleted
- Final Energy: 7,646J (95.6% capacity)

Total Energy Generated: 1,062J
Total Recovery During Combat: 800J
Net Energy Expenditure: 1,062J
```

**Energy Efficiency Comparison (Medium Weapon, 1.0× Efficiency):**
- **1 × 3-second haymaker**: 3,188J energy → 638 damage points (3,188J ÷ 5J per damage × 1.0 efficiency)
- **3 × 1-second jabs**: 1,062J total energy → 212 damage points total (354J per jab → 71 damage each)
- **Haymaker advantage**: Generates **200% more energy** but costs **200% more capacitor**
- **Critical insight**: Energy cost scales proportionally with energy generation

**Weapon Efficiency Impact:**
```
Same 354J jab with different weapons:
- Unarmed (0.382× efficiency): 354J × 0.382 ÷ 5J = 27 damage
- Light weapon (0.618× efficiency): 354J × 0.618 ÷ 5J = 44 damage
- Medium weapon (1.000× efficiency): 354J × 1.000 ÷ 5J = 71 damage
- Heavy weapon (1.618× efficiency): 354J × 1.618 ÷ 5J = 115 damage
```

**Why This Occurs:**
1. **Power spool-up**: All strikes must build from 0% to full power over 3 seconds
2. **Short strikes are inefficient**: 1-second jabs only reach 33% of maximum power
3. **Recovery windows**: Brief pauses between jabs enable energy regeneration
4. **Proportional energy costs**: Energy expenditure matches energy generation (no efficiency bonus)

**Tactical Consequences:**
- **Risk vs reward balance**: Haymakers generate more damage but cost proportionally more energy
- **Strategic resource management**: Players must balance devastating potential vs energy conservation
- **Telegraph vulnerability**: 3-second wind-ups provide massive opportunity for opponent reaction/interruption
- **Energy efficiency parity**: Both approaches have 1:1 energy generation to cost ratios

**Tactical Trade-offs:**

**Haymaker Advantages:**
- **3x damage potential**: Significantly more kinetic energy per strike
- **Single target focus**: All energy concentrated into one devastating blow
- **Breakthrough potential**: Can overcome heavy armor/defenses

**Haymaker Disadvantages:**
- **3x energy cost**: Depletes capacitor much faster
- **3-second telegraph**: Enormous reaction window for opponents
- **3.0 AP commitment**: Uses half the standard action point pool
- **All-or-nothing**: Miss wastes massive energy investment

**Jab Advantages:**
- **Energy conservation**: Minimal capacitor depletion per strike
- **Tactical flexibility**: Multiple opportunities to connect/adjust
- **Action economy**: Can mix strikes with movement/defense
- **Sustainable**: Can maintain pressure over extended engagements

**Jab Disadvantages:**
- **Low individual damage**: Each strike generates minimal kinetic energy
- **Requires multiple hits**: Must land several strikes for meaningful damage
- **Power limitations**: Cannot reach full power potential

This creates authentic tactical depth where both approaches have clear strengths and weaknesses, determined by mathematical physics rather than arbitrary balance mechanics.

### C. Armor and Momentum Counterplay Systems

The combat system incorporates **flat armor reduction per strike** and **motion-based hit difficulty** to create tactical rock-paper-scissors relationships between different combat approaches.

**Flat Armor Reduction Mechanics:**
$$D_{final} = \max\left(0, \frac{E_{kinetic} \times \eta_{weapon}}{5J} - A_{value}\right)$$

**Armor vs Attack Type Analysis:**
```
Example: 20-point armor reduction per blow

Against 3 × 71-damage jabs:
- Jab 1: 71 - 20 = 51 damage
- Jab 2: 71 - 20 = 51 damage
- Jab 3: 71 - 20 = 51 damage
- Total: 153 damage

Against 1 × 638-damage haymaker:
- Haymaker: 638 - 20 = 618 damage
- Total: 618 damage

Result: Haymaker deals 4× more effective damage despite same energy cost
```

**Motion-Based Hit Difficulty:**
Moving targets become increasingly difficult to hit with momentum-based attacks, creating natural counterplay dynamics:

- **Stationary targets**: Standard hit probability for all attack types
- **Moving targets**: Reduced hit probability for momentum-dependent attacks
- **High-speed targets**: Significant penalty to momentum attacks, minimal penalty to standard strikes

**Tactical Triangle Emerges:**

**Heavy Armor + Low Mobility:**
- **Strengths**: Immune to rapid combinations, devastating single strikes
- **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to momentum attacks from mobile opponents
- **Role**: Breakthrough specialist, area denial

**High Grace + Light Armor:**
- **Strengths**: Generates massive momentum damage, difficult to hit while moving
- **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to sustained rapid combinations, poor armor penetration
- **Role**: Anti-armor specialist, hit-and-run tactics

**Balanced Builds + Medium Equipment:**
- **Strengths**: Tactical flexibility, can adapt to opponent weaknesses
- **Weaknesses**: No overwhelming advantage in any matchup
- **Role**: Versatile combatant, strategic adaptation

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Armor favors single devastating strikes** over rapid combinations
- **Mobility counters momentum attacks** through evasion mechanics
- **Equipment choice determines tactical identity** and optimal engagement style
- **Physics creates natural balance** without artificial rock-paper-scissors mechanics

This system rewards players who understand the physics relationships and can adapt their tactics based on opponent builds and equipment choices.

### D. Dice and Execution Uncertainty

The combat system maintains **deterministic physics calculations** while incorporating **execution uncertainty** through dice rolls. This reflects the reality that while physics is predictable, successful execution in dynamic combat environments involves variables beyond perfect control.

**Core Principle: Physics is Always Deterministic**
- **354J energy always equals 71 damage** (medium weapon, no armor)
- **Damage calculations are exact and predictable**
- **Players can calculate precise outcomes** before committing to actions
- **Physics literacy provides concrete competitive advantage**

**Dice Role: Attack Execution Only**
Dice determine whether calculated damage is delivered, not how much damage occurs:

```
Attack Sequence:
1. Player commits to action (e.g., 3-second haymaker)
2. Physics calculates exact damage potential (638 points)
3. Dice roll determines hit/miss based on execution factors
4. If hit: Full calculated damage applies
5. If miss: Zero damage, energy still expended
```

**Execution Uncertainty Factors:**
- **Environmental variables**: Wind, terrain, lighting conditions
- **Timing precision**: Split-second execution windows
- **Target movement**: Evasion attempts and positioning changes
- **Combat stress**: Performance under pressure and fatigue

**Attack Roll Modifiers:**
- **Grace enhances accuracy for momentum-based attacks**: Better body control and precision while moving
- **Target movement reduces hit chance**: Motion-based evasion mechanics
- **External effects**: Weapons may confer bonuses or penalties as dice roll modifiers. The actor may be under the influence of some kind of status effect that reduces or enhances their accuracy.

**No Damage Variance or Critical Hits:**
- **No damage dice**: 354J energy produces exactly 71 damage every time
- **No arbitrary multipliers**: Devastating damage comes from physics, not random bonuses
- **Natural "critical hits"**: A 25 m/s momentum strike IS the critical hit
- **Predictable lethality**: Players know exactly when they possess killing potential

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Perfect information combat**: Players can calculate "if this haymaker lands, it deals exactly 638 damage"
- **Risk assessment**: Known damage potential enables precise tactical planning
- **Execution skill matters**: Success depends on creating favorable hit conditions
- **Physics mastery rewarded**: Understanding energy calculations provides measurable advantage

**Tactical Depth:**
The system creates chess-like strategic depth where players can perfectly calculate potential outcomes, but must still execute under uncertainty. This rewards both tactical planning (physics understanding) and execution skill (creating favorable attack conditions while avoiding opponent setups).
