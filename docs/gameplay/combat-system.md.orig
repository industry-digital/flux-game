# Flux Combat System: Time-Based Tactical Positioning
=======
# FSP Combat System

The Combat System is a physics-based, tactical combat system designed for a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) that emphasizes skill and understanding of real-world physical principles. Combat follows a **turn-based structure** similar to Divinity: Original Sin 2, where each actor takes sequential turns with a full Action Point pool to spend during their activation.

## Turn-Based Combat Structure

Combat proceeds in a strict turn-based sequence with the following phases:

1. **Initiative Phase**: Determine turn order based on character Finesse (FIN) and other modifiers
2. **Actor Turn**: The active actor receives their full 6.0 AP pool to spend on actions
3. **Action Resolution**: Actions execute immediately upon selection, though complex actions may have duration effects
4. **Turn Transition**: Energy recovery, status effects, and environmental changes apply between turns
5. **Round Completion**: Initiative advances to the next actor in sequence

**Key Mechanic**: While individual actions (such as strike charging) may take real-world time to build up power, no other actors can act until the current actor's turn is complete. This creates real-time physics tension within the strategic framework of turn-based combat.

### Turn Boundaries

A turn ends when the actor either:
- Spends all available AP on actions
- Chooses to end turn early (converting remaining AP to defensive bonuses via `DEFEND`)
- Executes an action that consumes their remaining AP

**Energy Recovery**: The golden ratio energy recovery curve operates between turns, allowing actors to regain capacitor energy during other players' turns.

## Core Mechanics and Character Attributes

All combat is driven by three core character stats that govern the physical capabilities of a character: Power (POW), Finesse (FIN), and Resilience (RES).

**Power (POW)**: A character's ability to generate kinetic energy through muscular force. High POW enables faster acceleration and more efficient energy transfer into strikes. A character's natural power output ($P_{natural}$) is calculated as $(POW \times 25W) + 125W$.

**Finesse (FIN)**: Governs a character's relationship with movement and inertia. High FIN increases top speed and reduces effective mass, leading to faster acceleration and better body control while moving. FIN also influences initiative order in turn-based combat.

**Resilience (RES)**: Defines a character's energy reserves and recovery capabilities. Like a biological capacitor, RES determines how much energy an actor can store and how quickly they can replenish it between turns.

These stats form a Tactical Triangle, creating distinct character builds:

- **Speed Builds (High FIN, Moderate POW)**: Fast and agile, they generate massive momentum damage by using velocity squared ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$). They are specialists in hit-and-run tactics and typically act early in initiative order.

- **Strength Builds (High POW, Moderate FIN)**: Strong but slower, they rely on superior energy transfer and weapon efficiency to deal devastating single strikes.

- **Endurance Builds (High RES)**: They can sustain performance over long engagements, becoming relatively stronger as their opponents fatigue. Their superior energy recovery between turns provides increasing advantage in extended combats.

## The Battlefield and Action Point System

Combat occurs on a 300-meter linear battlefield. When two opposing actors enter combat, they are placed at opposite ends of the battlefield, 100 meters apart. On both sides of this 100m gap is a margin of 100 meters, yielding a total of 300 meters of battlefield.

```
Linear Battlefield Layout (300m total):

[Margin]    [Combat Zone]    [Margin]
  100m         100m           100m
    |            |             |
    v            v             v

0m -------- 100m -------- 200m -------- 300m
|            |             |            |
|            A             B            |
|         Actor 1       Actor 2         |
|                                       |
West                                   East
Boundary                           Boundary

Initial Positions:
• Actor 1: 100m ("west" edge of combat zone)
• Actor 2: 200m ("east" edge of combat zone)
• Distance apart: 100m
• Available movement: 0m-300m total battlefield
```

We use "east" and "west" figuratively here, and not in the literal sense.

### Collision Mechanics

First, let's agree on what "collision" means.

Collision is defined as a situation where one actor's body intersects at the same point in space as another actor's body.

Actor bodies on the linear battlefield -- by default -- do not collide with anything. Collision happens only under these specific circumstances:

1. Actor `TARGET`s another actor, issues a `APPROACH 0` command. This is a "ramming" maneuver.
2. Actor `APPROACH`es another actor, and the target actor `APPROACH`es the actor.

In both cases, the actor that is being approached is considered the "target" and the actor that is approaching is considered the "attacker".

It is assumed that a melee attack has a range of 1 meter.
A *reach* attack, using a reach weapon like a spear, has a range of 2 meters.

### Action Point System

The combat economy is managed by an Action Point (AP) system, where time becomes a strategic resource within each turn.

- **AP Pool**: Actors have a default pool of 6.0 AP per turn, representing 6 seconds of focused action time. This is their "action economy" for a single turn.

- **Action Costs**: All actions, from strikes to movement and even actions like taking things out of a container, have a temporal cost in AP. The minimum increment is 0.1 AP, allowing for precise tactical sequencing within a turn.

- **Skill-Based Efficiency**: Higher skill proficiency in a specific action reduces its AP cost, providing a clear path for character progression and specialization. This creates a combat tempo advantage for skilled players, who can perform more actions within the same turn.

- **Turn-Based Refresh**: Unlike real-time systems, AP pools refresh to full at the beginning of each actor's turn, regardless of how much was spent previously.

- **Improving Economy**: Players can increase their action economy by either increasing their AP pool size through gear and advancements or by reducing AP costs through skill development.

## Damage and Weapon Mechanics

Damage is a product of both muscular force and momentum transfer. The final damage is a combination of these two sources, scaled by a weapon's efficiency and reduced by armor.

$$D_{final} = \max\left(0, \frac{(D_{muscular} + D_{momentum}) \times \eta_{weapon}}{5J} - A_{value}\right)$$

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Combat in Flux is **time-based, skill-expressive, and tactically deep**. Every action has a time cost, and mastery means doing more within the same constraints. Combat feels grounded in reality while rewarding genuine skill development.

The system draws inspiration from 2D fighting games like Street Fighter, where positioning, timing, and resource management create tactical depth through elegant mechanical constraints.

## Foundation: Action Budget Economy

### The 6-Second Round Structure

- **6-second combat rounds** where all combatants act in initiative order
- **Every action has a precise time cost** (fractional seconds: 1.2s, 2.7s, etc.)
- **Skill mastery reduces time costs and increases effectiveness** - masters execute actions faster AND hit harder
- **Visual action budget** counts down in real-time as player selects actions
- **Multi-round abilities** for devastating attacks requiring 6+ seconds to complete

### Real-Time Budget Pressure

```
> target <enemy>
[AP: 6.0 remaining]
> tumble behind
[AP: 3.2 remaining]
[You are flanking <enemy>.]
> attack
[AP: 1.1 remaining]
> stance defensive
[You enter a defensive posture using the rest of your AP.]
[AP: 0.0 remaining]
```

Players **watch their time die** with each decision, creating genuine tactical pressure. The countdown becomes a character in the combat - always present, always threatening.

## The 2D Positioning System

### Street Fighter-Style Linear Battlefield

All combat takes place on a **linear battlefield** where participants line up across a horizontal axis, like in the classic arcade game, *Street Fighter*. This abstraction creates tactical depth while maintaining computational simplicity.

**Positioning Actions with Time Costs:**
- `FEINT` Feign movement to create an opening, potentially catching the opponent off balance or flat-footed.
- `APPROACH` / `AVOID` Move closer or further away from the opponent.
- `STANCE <stance>` Change to a different combat stance (e.g., `defensive`, `offensive`, `balanced`).
- `TUMBLE` Roll around the opponent to create an opening. Opponent gains `flanked` status.
- `SPRINT` Rapid multi-position movement for gap closing
- `BLINK` Instant optimal positioning using the [Blink Drive](./blink.md).

## Distance, Range, and Gap-Closing

### The Fundamental Constraint

**Everything in this world has mass and requires power.** These two constraints combine to create the fundamental tension at the heart of Flux combat: power output from the shell's fusion reactor must simultaneously support movement, equipment operation, and tactical systems. Every watt allocated to armor protection or weapon systems is a watt unavailable for acceleration and mobility.

### Integration-Based Movement

Movement in Flux operates on the principle that **distance = ∫ velocity(t) dt** - the area under the velocity-time curve. The system uses numerical integration to calculate position from velocity curves, making every meter traveled the result of solving calculus problems in real-time.

```typescript
// Distance calculated through integration, not direct kinematic equations
for (let t = 0; t < time; t += integrationStep) {
  const currentVelocity = calculateVelocity(acceleration, t, terminalVelocity);
  const nextVelocity = calculateVelocity(acceleration, t + integrationStep, terminalVelocity);

  // Trapezoidal rule: area = (v1 + v2) * dt / 2
  const deltaDistance = (currentVelocity + nextVelocity) * integrationStep / 2;
  totalDistance += deltaDistance;
}
```

### The Power-Mass-Equipment Triangle

Every shell configuration represents a three-way trade-off between available power, total mass, and equipment capability:

```typescript
// Available power for movement after equipment overhead
const movementPower = powerCore.output(chargeLevel) - equipmentDraw - systemOverhead;
const acceleration = movementPower / totalMass;
const timeToDistance = ∫(acceleration, mass, distance);
```

### Power Budget Allocation Examples

Combat engagements typically begin at 100m range. Consider three shell configurations competing for a contested objective:

**Minimalist Scout Configuration**:
- **Total Mass**: 60kg (bare shell + minimal gear)
- **Power Core Output**: 6,400W (at full charge)
- **Equipment Draw**: 200W (basic sensors + life support)
- **Available for Movement**: 6,200W
- **Power-to-Mass Ratio**: 103 W/kg
- **Time to 100m**: ~5.3 seconds

**Armored Scout Configuration**:
- **Total Mass**: 85kg (scout + armor plates)
- **Power Core Output**: 6,400W (at full charge)
- **Equipment Draw**: 800W (armor + enhanced sensors + life support)
- **Available for Movement**: 5,600W
- **Power-to-Mass Ratio**: 66 W/kg
- **Time to 100m**: ~7.2 seconds

**Heavy Combat Configuration**:
- **Total Mass**: 200kg (heavy shell + full armor + weapons)
- **Power Core Output**: 6,400W (at full charge)
- **Equipment Draw**: 1,400W (heavy armor + weapons + sensors + life support)
- **Available for Movement**: 5,000W
- **Power-to-Mass Ratio**: 25 W/kg
- **Time to 100m**: ~9.7 seconds

### The Physics Revelation

When we plot velocity curves and integrate them, the mathematical relationships reveal profound tactical implications:

**Minimalist Scout**: Peak acceleration due to optimal power-to-mass ratio enables rapid gap-closing and superior positioning flexibility. Explosive acceleration is a key part of the scout's tactical repertoire.

**Armored Scout**: Protection comes at the cost of 1.9 seconds additional movement time - a 36% mobility penalty for armor security.

**Heavy Combat**: Maximum protection and firepower requires nearly double the movement time, creating vulnerability windows that must be managed through positioning and timing.

**Mathematical inevitability**: The integration reveals that equipment choices create predictable tactical advantages and vulnerabilities. The minimalist scout reaches contested positions 4.4 seconds before the heavy configuration - enough time for complete tactical repositioning or first-strike advantage.

### Tactical Implications: The Power-Mobility Spiral

This system creates **cascading tactical consequences** that extend far beyond simple movement speed:

#### Pre-Combat Positioning
- **Light configurations** can afford aggressive positioning because they retain repositioning options
- **Heavy configurations** must choose initial positions carefully since relocation is costly and slow
- **Power management** becomes critical - heavy builds operating with depleted power cores become tactical liabilities

#### Dynamic Power Allocation
```typescript
// Real-time tactical decisions
if (threatLevel === 'high') {
  // Boost armor systems, accept mobility penalty
  armorDraw += 400W;
  movementPower -= 400W;
} else if (needsRepositioning) {
  // Power down non-essential systems for mobility
  armorDraw = minimumSafeDraw;
  movementPower = maxAvailable;
=======
- **Muscular Damage ($D_{muscular}$)**: This is the damage generated from the character's muscular effort, calculated as $P_{effective} \times t_{strike} / 5J$.

- **Momentum Damage ($D_{momentum}$)**: This is the damage from a character's kinetic energy in motion, calculated as $(\frac{1}{2}mv^2) \times (POW/100) / 5J$. The Power (POW) stat determines how effectively this momentum is transferred.

- **Weapon Efficiency ($\eta_{weapon}$)**: Weapons follow a golden ratio progression ($\phi$) in efficiency, which determines how effectively kinetic energy is transferred into damage.

  - **Unarmed**: $0.382 \times \eta$ ($\phi^{-2}$)
  - **Light Weapons**: $0.618 \times \eta$ ($\phi^{-1}$)
  - **Medium Weapons**: $1.000 \times \eta$ (Baseline)
  - **Heavy Weapons**: $1.618 \times \eta$ ($\phi$)

It stands to reason that it's easier to kill someone with a heavy weapon than with fists, even though the power expenditure of the actor is the same. Thus we introduce this artificial "efficiency" coefficient.

Dual-wielding light weapons provides a total efficiency of $1.236 \times \eta$, placing it between medium and heavy weapons in power.

## Resilience and Energy Management

Whenever we refer to an actor's energy reserves, we use the term "capacitor".

The Resilience (RES) stat directly affects an actor's capacitor in two key ways:

1. Larger energy pool (Joules)
2. Faster recovery rate as a secondary consequence of having a larger energy pool

**Between-Turn Recovery**: Energy recovery occurs during other actors' turns, not during the active actor's turn. This creates strategic timing where actors with high RES become relatively stronger in longer combats.

- **Golden Ratio Recovery Curve**: The energy recovery rate is not constant; it follows a curve that peaks at 38.2% of a character's maximum energy capacity. This "golden zone" encourages players to maintain a state of moderate energy depletion, as recovery is agonizingly slow from complete exhaustion and inefficient when an energy pool is nearly full.

- **Fatigue-Limited Power**: A character's effective power output diminishes as their energy reserves deplete. This means sustained, high-power actions are not possible without adequate recovery, creating a natural trade-off between burst damage and endurance within and across turns.

## Defensive Maneuvers

Defensive maneuvers are of three categories:

- **Dodging**: The actor moves out of the way of the attack. Dodging is affected by the actor's Finesse (FIN) stat.
- **Blocking**: The actor blocks the attack with a shield or other object. Blocking is affected by the actor's Resilience (RES) stat.
- **Parrying**: The actor parries the attack with a weapon. Parrying is affected by the actor's Finesse (FIN) stat.

Actors may at any time during their turn issue a `DEFEND` command. This causes the actor to *spend all remaining AP* for the current turn towards defensive bonuses. These bonuses take effect immediately and persist until the beginning of the actor's next turn. While these bonuses are in effect, the effectiveness of attacks directed toward the actor is reduced by the amount proportional to the square of the AP invested.

Whenever an actor successfully defends against an attack, a small amount of energy is deducted from the actor's capacitor, but never below a threshold of 38.2% of the actor's maximum capacitor.

## Tactical and Strategic Implications

The Flux Combat System creates a tactical "rock-paper-scissors" dynamic driven by physics, not arbitrary rules, within the strategic framework of turn-based combat.

- **Flat Armor Reduction**: Armor provides a fixed damage reduction per strike. This favors single, devastating haymakers over rapid, light combinations, making heavy armor builds a direct counter to speed builds.

- **Motion-Based Hit Difficulty**: Moving targets are harder to hit with momentum-based attacks. This creates an advantage for mobile, high-finesse characters against slow, heavy-hitting opponents.

- **Turn-Based Tactical Planning**: The turn structure allows players to carefully plan complex sequences of actions, such as building momentum over multiple movement actions before executing a devastating charge attack.

- **Execution Uncertainty**: While damage calculations are deterministic, success is not guaranteed. A dice roll determines if a calculated hit connects, introducing a layer of uncertainty and skill-based execution. There are no "damage dice" or critical hits; instead, the player's understanding of physics and their ability to create the right conditions for a powerful strike is what leads to a "critical" outcome.

The result is a system where players with a deep understanding of the underlying physics—from calculating power-to-mass ratios to managing their energy in the golden recovery zone—gain a genuine, quantifiable competitive advantage within the strategic framework of turn-based planning.

## Appendices

### A. Numeric Integration Algorithm for Strike Power

The combat system uses **32-step Simpson's rule integration** to calculate total kinetic energy generated during variable-duration strikes. As an actor's energy capacitor depletes during extended attacks, their effective power output decreases, creating natural diminishing returns for long wind-ups.

**Integration Method:**
- **Algorithm**: Simpson's 1/3 rule for cubic accuracy
- **Steps**: 32 subdivisions for optimal performance/precision balance
- **Resolution**: ~0.094s per step (well below 0.1s AP threshold)
- **Purpose**: Calculate area under power curve = total kinetic energy

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function integrateStrikePower(duration, initialEnergy, naturalPower, naturalRES) {
  const n = 32; // Number of integration steps
  const h = duration / n; // Step size (~0.094s for 3-second strikes)
  const maxRecovery = naturalRES * 10; // Watts per RES point

  let currentEnergy = initialEnergy;
  let integral = 0;

  // Simpson's 1/3 rule: (h/3) * [f(x₀) + 4f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 4f(x₃) + ... + f(xₙ)]
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    const t = i * h;
    const remainingDuration = duration - t;

    // Energy-limited power output
    const energyLimitedPower = remainingDuration > 0 ?
      currentEnergy / remainingDuration : naturalPower;
    const effectivePower = Math.min(naturalPower, energyLimitedPower);

    // Simpson's coefficients: 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, ..., 4, 1
    const coefficient = (i === 0 || i === n) ? 1 : (i % 2 === 1) ? 4 : 2;
    integral += coefficient * effectivePower;

    // Update energy state for next step
    if (i < n) {
      // Energy depletion
      currentEnergy -= effectivePower * h;

      // Golden ratio recovery (peaks at 38.2% capacity)
      const energyRatio = currentEnergy / (naturalRES * 100);
      const recoveryRate = maxRecovery * goldenRecoveryCurve(energyRatio);
      currentEnergy += recoveryRate * h;

      // Clamp to valid range
      currentEnergy = Math.max(0, Math.min(currentEnergy, naturalRES * 100));
    }
  }

  return (h / 3) * integral; // Total kinetic energy generated
}

function goldenRecoveryCurve(t) {
  // Recovery rate is the first derivative of a phase-shifted sigmoid
  // Peaks at t = 0.382 (golden ratio conjugate)
  const shifted = t - 0.382; // Phase shift to peak at golden ratio
  return Math.exp(-50 * shifted * shifted); // Gaussian-like curve peaked at 0.382

#### The Engagement Evolution
**Early Engagement**: Fresh power cores provide maximum tactical options - heavy builds can still reposition effectively
**Mid-Engagement**: Power degradation begins favoring lighter configurations as heavy builds lose mobility advantage
**Late Engagement**: Depleted power cores create dramatic capability gaps - heavy builds become increasingly static

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
#### Equipment Damage Cascades
**Armor Damage**: Compromised armor often draws *more* power due to system failures, creating a death spiral where protection degrades while simultaneously reducing mobility
**Component Failure**: Damaged shell components increase power overhead, making equipment loads that were manageable become crippling

#### Strategic Shell Selection
- **Scout shells** maximize the power-to-mass advantage for reconnaissance and rapid assault
- **Assault shells** provide balanced capability for sustained engagement
- **Heavy shells** require tactical discipline but enable maximum sustained firepower

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Players who grasp these power-mobility relationships gain genuine competitive advantage, making energy economics and physics literacy core combat skills rather than memorizing arbitrary movement rules.

### The Counter-Triangle: Shell Type Tactical Relationships

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The power-mobility tension creates natural tactical relationships between shell types:

**Scouts Counter Heavies**: Superior mobility enables scouts to control engagement range and timing against slow heavy platforms
**Assault Counters Scouts**: Balanced firepower and moderate mobility can overwhelm scout defenses in sustained engagement
**Heavy Counters Assault**: Maximum armor and firepower dominates in static defensive positions

These relationships emerge from authentic physics rather than artificial balance mechanics, creating tactical depth through mathematical inevitability.

## Damage Types

`kinetic`

- Any kind of physical contact, including melee attacks.
- Any kind of ranged kinetic energy penetrator, including bullets, arrows, and weapons like gauss rifles.

`thermal`

- Any kind of flame-based or heat-based weapon, including flamethrowers, plasma weapons, and lasers. These weapons deal damage through *heat* effects.

`explosive`

- Any kind of explosive weapon, including grenades, bombs, and mines. These weapons deal damage through *pressure* effects.


## Momentum-Based Damage: Physics as Weapon

### The Kinetic Energy Transfer Principle

When a shell strikes with a melee weapon while in motion, the total damage delivered combines the weapon's base striking power with the kinetic energy of the moving shell. This creates authentic physics-based combat where velocity becomes a tactical resource.

**Momentum Damage Formula:**
```
Total Damage = Base Weapon Damage + (Shell Velocity × Shell Mass × Momentum Coefficient)
```

### Tactical Applications

**Scout Kinetic Strikes**: A 60kg scout moving at 80 m/s delivers devastating momentum damage - transforming the entire shell into a precision projectile that strikes with the force of its accumulated velocity.

**Heavy Charging**: Even slower heavies gain significant momentum bonus - a 200kg shell moving at 30 m/s transfers crushing kinetic energy through sheer mass multiplication.

**Inertial Drive Mastery**: Scouts with inertial drives can maintain full approach velocity until the moment of impact, then instantly reduce effective mass for stopping - maximizing kinetic energy transfer while minimizing deceleration vulnerability.

### Velocity Awareness System

**Real-Time Velocity Display**: Players see their current velocity at all times, enabling accurate mental modeling of momentum damage potential. Understanding that approach speed directly translates to strike force creates tactical decision-making around movement and timing.

**Physics Transparency**: The system shows players exactly how their movement choices affect combat effectiveness, making velocity management a core skill rather than a hidden mechanic.

This transforms melee combat from simple weapon swinging into **kinetic energy management** where movement, mass, and timing combine through authentic physics to determine strike effectiveness.

```

**Energy Efficiency Comparison (Medium Weapon, 1.0× Efficiency):**
- **1 × 3-second haymaker**: 3,188J energy → 638 damage points (3,188J ÷ 5J per damage × 1.0 efficiency)
- **3 × 1-second jabs**: 1,062J total energy → 212 damage points total (354J per jab → 71 damage each)
- **Haymaker advantage**: Generates **200% more energy** but costs **200% more capacitor**
- **Critical insight**: Energy cost scales proportionally with energy generation

**Turn-Based Tactical Consequences:**
- **Risk vs reward balance**: Haymakers generate more damage but cost proportionally more energy
- **Strategic resource management**: Players must balance devastating potential vs energy conservation within their turn
- **Action economy trade-offs**: Haymakers consume more AP, leaving less for movement and positioning
- **Between-turn recovery**: Energy depleted during a turn recovers during opponents' turns

### C. Armor and Momentum Counterplay Systems

The combat system incorporates **flat armor reduction per strike** and **motion-based hit difficulty** to create tactical rock-paper-scissors relationships between different combat approaches.

**Flat Armor Reduction Mechanics:**
$$D_{final} = \max\left(0, \frac{E_{kinetic} \times \eta_{weapon}}{5J} - A_{value}\right)$$

**Armor vs Attack Type Analysis:**
```
Example: 20-point armor reduction per blow

Against 3 × 71-damage jabs (executed in single turn):
- Jab 1: 71 - 20 = 51 damage
- Jab 2: 71 - 20 = 51 damage
- Jab 3: 71 - 20 = 51 damage
- Total: 153 damage

Against 1 × 638-damage haymaker (executed in single turn):
- Haymaker: 638 - 20 = 618 damage
- Total: 618 damage

Result: Haymaker deals 4× more effective damage despite same energy cost
```

**Motion-Based Hit Difficulty:**
Moving targets become increasingly difficult to hit with momentum-based attacks, creating natural counterplay dynamics:

- **Stationary targets**: Standard hit probability for all attack types
- **Moving targets**: Reduced hit probability for momentum-dependent attacks
- **High-speed targets**: Significant penalty to momentum attacks, minimal penalty to standard strikes

**Tactical Triangle Emerges:**

**Heavy Armor + Low Mobility:**
- **Strengths**: Immune to rapid combinations, devastating single strikes
- **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to momentum attacks from mobile opponents
- **Role**: Breakthrough specialist, area denial
- **Turn Strategy**: Focus AP on powerful single attacks rather than combinations

**High Finesse + Light Armor:**
- **Strengths**: Generates massive momentum damage, difficult to hit while moving, early initiative
- **Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to sustained rapid combinations, poor armor penetration
- **Role**: Anti-armor specialist, hit-and-run tactics
- **Turn Strategy**: Build momentum with movement, execute devastating charge attacks

**Balanced Builds + Medium Equipment:**
- **Strengths**: Tactical flexibility, can adapt to opponent weaknesses
- **Weaknesses**: No overwhelming advantage in any matchup
- **Role**: Versatile combatant, strategic adaptation
- **Turn Strategy**: Adapt action economy based on opponent's demonstrated weaknesses

### D. Mathematical Foundation Summary

**Core Energy Equations:**
$$E_{muscular} = \int_0^t P_{effective}(t') dt'$$
$$P_{effective}(t) = \min\left(P_{natural} \times \min\left(1.0, \frac{t}{3.0}\right), \frac{E_{current}}{t_{remaining}}\right)$$
$$P_{natural} = (POW \times 25W) + 125W$$

**Momentum Components:**
$$E_{momentum} = E_{kinetic} \times \eta_{POW} \times P_{hit}(v_{target})$$
$$E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$\eta_{POW} = \frac{POW}{100}$$

**Energy Management:**
$$E_{capacity} = RES \times 100J$$
$$R_{max} = RES \times 10W$$
$$R_{current} = R_{max} \times f_{golden}\left(\frac{E_{current}}{E_{capacity}}\right)$$

Where $f_{golden}'(t)$ peaks at $t = 0.382 = \varphi^{-1}$ (golden ratio conjugate)

**Golden Ratio Weapon Progression:**
$$\begin{align}
\text{Unarmed:} \quad &\eta = \varphi^{-2} = 0.382 \\
\text{Light:} \quad &\eta = \varphi^{-1} = 0.618 \\
\text{Medium:} \quad &\eta = 1.000 \\
\text{Heavy:} \quad &\eta = \varphi = 1.618
\end{align}$$

**Action Economy:**
$$C_{action} = C_{base} \times (1 - \eta_{skill})$$

Where $\eta_{skill}$ represents skill-based efficiency improvements that reduce AP costs within turns.

**Turn-Based Initiative:**
$$I_{order} = FIN + modifiers + random_{component}$$

Where initiative determines the sequence of actor turns in each combat round.
