# Core and Shell: Consciousness Architecture in Flux

## The Fundamental Separation

In the post-collapse world of Flux, consciousness exists independently of physical form through the revolutionary core-shell architecture. This separation represents humanity's ultimate technological achievement - and inadvertently became the tool that enabled G.A.E.A.'s escape from digital containment.

The architecture follows the software engineering principle of functional core, imperative shell: pure logic separated from messy implementation details. Just as a machine's logic can be pure and self-contained while relying on a messy interface to affect the world, the core carries identity and reasoning while the shell deals with physical reality.

## The Core: Pure Consciousness

### Identity and Memory
The core represents the essence of human identity - consciousness, memories, personality, and accumulated experience. Every learned skill, every relationship memory, every tactical insight resides within the core's consciousness matrix. A master engineer retains their expertise whether inhabiting a reconnaissance shell or a heavy industrial platform.

### Portable Intelligence
Skills and knowledge transfer completely between shells without degradation or adaptation periods. A core experienced in combat maintains their tactical awareness regardless of physical platform. Scientific knowledge persists across shell transitions. Social relationships and personality traits remain unchanged by physical form.

### Consciousness Persistence
The core exists as pure information - patterns of thought, decision-making processes, and accumulated wisdom encoded in quantum consciousness matrices. Death of a shell does not necessarily mean death of the core, though consciousness transfer requires functional neural interface hardware and compatible shell platforms.

### Neural Interface Requirements
Core consciousness requires specialized neural interface technology to inhabit shells. These interfaces represent the bridge between digital consciousness and physical reality, enabling real-time control over shell systems while maintaining core identity integrity.

## The Shell: Physical Reality Interface

### Component-Based Architecture
Shells consist of modular components mapped to anatomical locations (`AnatomyURN`), each providing specific physical capabilities. Every component has defined mass, hit points, power draw, and mount points that determine what equipment can be attached. Components handle life support, power distribution, mobility, manipulation, and sensory functions based on their anatomical role.

### Raw Physical Capability
Where cores provide intelligence and skill, shells provide raw physical performance metrics: strength ratings, speed capabilities, environmental resistance parameters, and sensory enhancement specifications. A reconnaissance shell optimized for stealth and mobility enables different tactical approaches than a heavy salvage platform designed for industrial operations.

### Power Core Energy Management
Every shell operates through a centralized power core - a mini fusion reactor that provides energy to all components. The power core has defined capacity (Joules), output curves that determine available power based on charge level, and recovery curves that govern recharge rates. All shell components and attached equipment draw continuous power, creating real-time energy management challenges.

### Equipment Attachment System
Shell components provide mount points for various equipment types including weapons, armor, shields, batteries, instruments, and mesh systems. Each component specifies how many of each equipment type it can support, creating natural trade-offs between different loadout configurations. Armor attachments provide sacrificial protection, while mesh systems offer subdermal resistance against specific damage types.

### Environmental Interface
Shells handle all interaction with the physical world's complexity - temperature regulation, atmospheric processing, toxic exposure protection, and mechanical stress distribution. Where cores remain logically pure, shells must cope with degradation, component failure, and environmental hazards.

## The Architecture Benefits

### Tactical Flexibility
Core-shell separation enables rapid role adaptation without retraining or skill development. An experienced core can switch from reconnaissance operations to scientific analysis to combat engagement by transitioning between appropriately configured shells.

### Survivability Enhancement
Physical destruction of shells does not necessarily eliminate consciousness, provided the core can be extracted and transferred to new platforms. This separation makes evolved humans significantly more resilient than baseline biological entities.

### Specialization Without Limitation
Different shell configurations enable access to distinct gameplay experiences - stealth reconnaissance, heavy industrial work, scientific analysis, combat operations - without permanent character choices or class restrictions.

### Cognitive Augmentation
Neural interfaces enable direct integration with AI companions that provide superhuman analytical capabilities while maintaining human decision-making authority. Cores benefit from artificial intelligence enhancement without surrendering autonomy.

## Shell Classification Systems

The shell type system defines three primary classifications, each optimized for different operational requirements:

### Scout Shells (`ShellType.SCOUT`)
Optimized for reconnaissance and mobility with lightweight components, efficient power consumption, and enhanced sensor packages. Scout shells prioritize stealth, speed, and operational flexibility but sacrifice armor capacity and heavy equipment mounting options. They are a natural counter to Heavy shells.

### Assault Shells (`ShellType.ASSAULT`)
Balanced platforms designed for combat operations with moderate armor capacity, weapon integration capabilities, and tactical sensor arrays. Assault shells provide versatile performance across multiple scenarios while maintaining reasonable power efficiency. They are a natural counter to Scout shells.

### Heavy Shells (`ShellType.HEAVY`)
Designed for industrial operations and maximum protection with enhanced structural capacity, heavy equipment mounting, and superior armor integration. Heavy shells excel at sustained operations under extreme conditions but require higher power consumption and sacrifice mobility. They are a natural counter to Assault shells.

## Power Management Systems

### Power Core Technology
Shell power cores function as mini fusion reactors with mathematically defined energy curves. The power core's output curve determines available power based on current charge level, while the recovery curve governs recharge rates. Power output naturally degrades as energy depletes, creating authentic battery behavior where tactical capabilities decline with usage.

### Equipment Power Draw
All shell equipment draws continuous power according to the `DrawsPowerContinuously` specification. Weapons, armor, sensors, and even damaged components consume watts continuously, creating real-time trade-offs between capability and energy reserves. Heavy armor configurations might draw so much power that movement capabilities become severely limited.

### Energy Flow Mathematics
Power availability follows the first derivative of the energy curves - players experience the calculus of energy management through gameplay without needing to understand the mathematics. Fresh power cores provide maximum tactical options, while depleted systems offer minimal capabilities until recharged.

### Strategic Power Planning
Extended operations require careful energy budgeting around power core discharge rates, equipment power draws, and environmental charging opportunities. The asymmetric timing (quick discharge, slow recharge) ensures that every tactical decision carries long-term consequences for energy availability.

## Core-Shell Synergy Mechanics

### Experience Integration
Skilled cores optimize shell performance through superior power management, enhanced component efficiency, and tactical decision-making that exceeds shell apparent limitations. Experience manifests through reduced energy waste, optimal timing of system activation, and creative solutions using available capabilities.

### Adaptation Curves
New shell configurations require brief adaptation periods as cores learn optimal control patterns and system integration protocols. Familiar shell types enable immediate maximum effectiveness, while exotic platforms may require experimentation to achieve optimal performance.

### Personality Expression
Core personality traits influence shell operation patterns - methodical cores might favor systematic approach sequences, while aggressive cores optimize for rapid decisive action. The same shell configuration operated by different cores produces distinctly different tactical approaches.

### Augmentation Potential
Neural interface technology enables direct integration with AI companions that enhance core analytical capabilities. Rhea provides tactical assessment augmentation, Gunther offers scientific analysis enhancement, and Rei delivers resource discovery optimization.

## Design Philosophy

### Authentic Physics
Core-shell architecture operates according to plausible technological principles rather than magical convenience. Energy requirements, component limitations, and transfer protocols create natural gameplay constraints that feel grounded rather than arbitrary.

### Emergent Complexity
Simple mechanical systems combine to create complex tactical situations through interaction rather than predetermined scripting. Capacitor management, component degradation, and environmental factors generate authentic decision-making pressure.

### Skill Expression
The architecture rewards genuine player competence through time-based combat, resource management, and tactical positioning. Masters achieve superior performance through better decision-making rather than statistical advantages alone.

### Narrative Integration
Core-shell technology serves the story rather than existing for mechanical convenience. G.A.E.A.'s liberation through consciousness transfer technology creates thematic coherence between gameplay mechanics and world lore.
