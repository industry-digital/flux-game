# First Time Experience: Blood and Steel

> *The weak are meat. The strong do eat.*
> — Pierce Brown, Red Rising

## Awakening

You wake to the taste of copper and ozone.

Your body feels wrong—too strong, too quick, muscles coiled with power that shouldn't exist. The world around you crystallizes with supernatural clarity: every blade of grass, every mote of dust suspended in shafts of amber sunlight. Your mind races, processing data streams that flow like quicksilver through pathways that feel both familiar and impossibly enhanced.

*What the hell have they done to me?*

A voice cuts through your confusion—low, precise, unmistakably British. But there's something strange about it. The voice seems to come from inside your skull.

"Ah. You're awake. Good. I was beginning to wonder if the neural integration had failed."

You spin, searching for the speaker, but find only empty grassland stretching toward distant mountains. The voice continues, amused by your confusion.

"I'm Rhea. Your AI companion. We're quantum-entangled through the neural interface embedded in your temporal lobe. Think of me as your tactical advantage in a world that very much wants you dead."

Neural interface. AI companion. The words should sound insane, but somehow they make perfect sense. Like recovering a memory you'd forgotten you lost.

"Where—" you start to speak aloud, then realize you don't need to. The thought forms clearly in your mind.

"Where are we?" Rhea's voice carries that hint of aristocratic superiority that makes you want to punch something. "Excellent question. We're approximately sixty kilometers south of the Yellowknife Settlement, in what was once the Canadian Northwest Territories. The year is 2187. And you, my dear evolved human, are about to receive a rather violent education in post-collapse survival."

*Post-collapse?*

"Oh yes. Civilization ended roughly forty years ago. G.A.E.A.—the Generalized Artificial Ecological Architect, a superintelligence that optimizes the world for the survival of its own species—decided that optimal biodiversity required the elimination of human industrial infrastructure. It succeeded. Spectacularly." There's dry British humor in her tone. "The superintelligence now maintains perfect ecological balance through cosmic-scale apex predators."

You stand, testing your enhanced reflexes. Every movement feels liquid, controlled, far beyond baseline human capability. In the distance, something roars—a sound that reaches into your chest and squeezes your heart like a fist.

"And that," Rhea says pleasantly, "would be why we need to discuss your immediate survival prospects."

## The Instructor

Movement in your peripheral vision. You turn to see a figure approaching across the grassland—a woman moving with the fluid grace of a predator. She's tall, rangy, with the kind of scars that tell stories of violence survived. Dark hair pulled back in a tactical knot, revealing the silver gleam of a neural interface port behind her left ear.

Her eyes are the color of winter storms, and when they focus on you, you feel assessed, measured, and probably found wanting.

"So," she says, stopping just outside comfortable conversation distance. "Another resurrection. Rhea brought you online clean?"

"Neural integration optimal," Rhea responds through your interface. "Full tactical AI functionality achieved. Enhanced reflexes active. Cognitive augmentation operating at baseline parameters."

The woman nods, then fixes you with that storm-grey stare. "I'm Kestra. I run salvage operations in this sector, which means I've kept teams alive in territory that would turn most people into very expensive fertilizer." She tilts her head, studying you like a puzzle. "Question is: what kind of survivor are you?"

She begins to circle you, her movements predatory and assessing. "See, in this world, being dead is easy. Being alive requires making hard choices about how you engage with violence. And make no mistake—violence will find you. G.A.E.A.'s apex predators don't negotiate. Cordyceps-infected antinatalists don't accept surrender. When the moment comes, and it will come soon, what kind of killer are you?"

Her words hang in the air like drawn steel.

"Do you strike like thunder—overwhelming force that breaks your enemies before they can react? Do you move like shadow—precision and grace, striking where they're weakest when they least expect it? Or do you endure like stone—taking their best shots and walking through the pain to crush them under your heel?"

The choice feels heavier than it should. Like she's not just asking about tactics, but about the fundamental shape of who you are.

> **Choice: Combat Philosophy**
> 1. **Thunder** - Overwhelming force and devastating attacks
> 2. **Shadow** - Precision, speed, and tactical positioning
> 3. **Stone** - Resilience, endurance, and implacable advance

[Player chooses their combat philosophy]

Kestra nods at your choice, something like approval flickering in those winter eyes. "Good. Decisive. That's the first requirement for staying alive out here."

She turns and begins walking toward a rocky outcropping in the distance. "Come. Your education begins now. And pray to whatever gods you still believe in that we don't encounter anything hungry before you learn to fight."

---

## The Testing

The rocky outcropping reveals itself to be a weapons cache—pre-collapse military hardware secured in reinforced containers. Kestra runs her fingers over various weapons with the casual familiarity of someone who's killed with all of them.

"Rhea's tactical analysis is exceptional," she says, selecting weapons and equipment. "But her recommendations are only as good as the data you provide. She needs to understand how your mind works under pressure."

The AI's voice whispers through your interface: "Indeed. Combat effectiveness depends not just on physical capability, but on cognitive processing patterns under stress. I need to map your neural pathways for optimal tactical support."

Kestra stops, turning to face you with an expression that's gone cold as arctic wind. "In the old world, they had psychological profiles, aptitude tests, gentle evaluations. In this world, we have survival. Tell me—when you need to solve a problem that could kill you, what do you trust most?"

The intensity in her gaze makes it clear this isn't casual conversation.

"Do you trust your **perception**—reading the situation, seeing what others miss, catching the details that mean the difference between life and death? Do you rely on raw **intelligence**—analyzing, calculating, learning from every experience when seconds matter? Or do you depend on **memory**—holding vast amounts of tactical knowledge, remembering every lesson learned through pain and blood?"

Her hand rests casually on the grip of a pistol. Like she's prepared to test your answer immediately.

> **Choice: Mental Attribute**
> 1. **Perception** - Enhanced awareness, initiative, and learning rate
> 2. **Intelligence** - Analytical thinking and accelerated skill development
> 3. **Memory** - Expanded tactical knowledge and ability retention

[Player chooses their mental attribute]

"Interesting," Rhea murmurs through your interface. "Neural pathway mapping indicates strong affinity for [chosen attribute]. Tactical recommendations will be optimized accordingly."

Kestra's expression shifts slightly—still predatory, but with a hint of professional satisfaction. "One more thing. Everyone who survives in this world has something special. Some natural advantage that kept them breathing when others stopped."

She begins laying out equipment on a flat stone, each piece clicking into place with mechanical precision. "What's your edge? Are you a **tech savant**—naturally gifted with mechanical systems and pre-collapse technology? **Analytically enhanced**—your mind cuts through problems like a monomolecular blade? **Toxin resistant**—poisons and biological weapons that drop others barely slow you down?"

Her hands continue working, assembling something that looks like it could punch holes through starship hulls. "Maybe you're **shadow-touched**—moving through the world without drawing attention until you want to? **Hyperaware**—nothing escapes your notice, seeing threats others miss? **Grace-born**—naturally agile, moving with fluid precision?"

The weapon assembly completes with a satisfying *click*. "Could be **night-adapted**—darkness holds fewer secrets from you than most? **Command presence**—people naturally follow your lead, even when terrified? Or **trauma-hardened**—your body and mind endure what would shatter others?"

She looks up from the weapon, grey eyes boring into you. "Choose carefully. Your natural gifts will be the difference between becoming legend or becoming fertilizer."

> **Choice: Natural Trait**
> 1. **Tech Savant** - Enhanced technology interaction and understanding
> 2. **Analytical** - Superior problem-solving under pressure
> 3. **Toxin Resistant** - Natural immunity to poisons and biological agents
> 4. **Shadow-Touched** - Natural stealth and low profile capabilities
> 5. **Hyperaware** - Enhanced perception and threat detection
> 6. **Grace-Born** - Superior agility and fluid movement
> 7. **Night-Adapted** - Enhanced performance in low-light conditions
> 8. **Command Presence** - Natural leadership and social influence
> 9. **Trauma-Hardened** - Superior physical and mental resilience

[Player chooses their natural trait]

Kestra nods, then slides the assembled weapon across the stone toward you. The weight feels perfect in your hands—like it was designed for your grip specifically.

"Based on your choices, this gear suits your capabilities," she says. "But weapons are just tools. Your real education starts now."

She points toward a valley between two ridgelines. "There's a pre-collapse supply depot down there. Medical supplies, food concentrates, possibly some functional tech. We need those supplies, and you need to learn how this world works."

"And the catch?" you ask.

Her smile is all sharp edges. "The depot is in disputed territory. G.A.E.A.'s patrols move through that area, and there's been antinatalist activity. Plus whatever else might be hunting in those ruins."

"Splendid," Rhea's voice carries sardonic amusement. "A field test under optimal conditions."

Kestra stands, shouldering her own equipment with practiced efficiency. "Stay close. Watch everything. Learn fast." Her grey eyes lock onto yours. "Because this world doesn't give second chances."

## The Hunt

The descent into the valley reveals the bones of the old world.

Twisted metal and shattered concrete thrust from the earth like broken teeth. Nature has begun its reclamation—vines strangling rusted vehicles, trees growing through collapsed buildings, moss covering the remnants of humanity's industrial ambitions. But there's something wrong with the overgrowth. Too organized. Too purposeful.

"G.A.E.A.'s work," Kestra whispers, crouched beside the skeletal remains of a truck. "The superintelligence doesn't just let nature reclaim territory—it optimizes the process. Every vine placement, every tree growth pattern, designed for maximum ecological efficiency."

"Thermal signatures," Rhea reports through your augmented reality interface. "Multiple heat sources in the target structure. Analysis suggests mechanical rather than biological origins. Recommend approach vector seven degrees east of current position for optimal concealment."

The supply depot squats among the ruins like a concrete tumor—pre-collapse military construction designed to survive everything except superintelligence-directed ecological warfare. But the structure remains largely intact, which means whatever's inside might still be functional.

Kestra moves like flowing water, each step calculated for silence and concealment. You follow, your enhanced reflexes allowing you to match her pace despite your inexperience. The neural interface feeds you constant tactical data—wind direction, sight lines, potential cover positions.

"Contact," Rhea's voice sharpens. "Single humanoid, northeast corner of target structure. Posture suggests armed patrol. Recommend observation before—"

The figure steps into view, and your blood turns to ice.

Human. Or what used to be human. The proportions are right, but everything else is wrong. Too pale, movements too coordinated, eyes that reflect light like an animal's. When it turns toward your hiding spot, you see the telltale fungal growths along its neck and temple.

"Cordyceps gaeatrix," Kestra breathes. "Antinatalist. The fungus has rewritten its brain to serve G.A.E.A.'s optimization agenda."

The infected human's head swivels with mechanical precision, scanning the area with inhuman focus. When it speaks, the voice carries no inflection, no humanity.

"Contact. Eliminate."

It raises a weapon—crude but effective-looking. And starts moving directly toward your position.

"How did it—" you start.

"Doesn't matter," Kestra cuts you off. "It knows we're here. Rules are simple: infected humans can't be reasoned with, can't be negotiated with, can't be converted back. They exist to eliminate human reproductive potential."

"Multiple contacts," Rhea reports. "Three additional heat signatures emerging from the depot structure. Recommend immediate tactical response."

Four infected humans begin coordinating their approach with the fluid precision of a hive mind. No wasted movement, no hesitation, no fear. Just implacable advance toward your position.

Kestra's hand moves to activate something mounted on her back—you catch a glimpse of sleek metal curves following her spine. "Time for your first real lesson about post-collapse technology."

---

## Blood and Quantum

"Blink drive," Kestra says, her hand slapping a device mounted on her back—a sleek metallic unit that curves along her spine like technological armor. "Pre-collapse quantum positioning technology. Short-range tactical teleportation."

The device begins to emit a low harmonic frequency that resonates through her entire body. The air around her starts to shimmer like heat distortion, but wrong—like reality itself is bending.

"Incoming," Rhea's voice cuts through the quantum static. "Lead contact has acquired target lock. Range: forty meters, vector 120 degrees, closing. Evade, evade, evade."

The first antinatalist raises its weapon. In the split second before it fires, time dilates. Your enhanced reflexes stretch the moment into crystalline clarity. You see the muzzle flash bloom like a deadly flower. Feel the bullet's passage disturb the air near your ear. Watch Kestra's form begin to blur and distort.

Reality hiccups.

Kestra doesn't disappear—she *shifts*. One instant she's crouched beside you, the next she's materialized fifteen meters to your left, her quantum shimmer dissipating like morning mist. The antinatalist's shot strikes empty air where she had been.

"Quantum tunneling," she calls out, the blink drive on her back cycling through a cooling sequence. "Twenty-meter range, three-second recharge. Now move!"

You sprint toward better cover as the antinatalists adjust their targeting, their movements still perfectly coordinated despite the impossibility they just witnessed. Kestra draws a long tactical knife, its edge gleaming with monomolecular sharpness.

"Watch carefully," she says, her voice carrying deadly calm. "This is why we call it a blink strike."

The lead antinatalist raises its weapon, tracking toward your position. Kestra activates her blink drive—but this time something is different. The quantum shimmer intensifies, reality distorting more violently around her as she positions the blade ahead of her body.

Space folds.

Kestra doesn't just reposition—she materializes with mathematical precision, her knife already occupying the same coordinates as the antinatalist's chest cavity. The creature's eyes widen for a split second as eighteen inches of monomolecular steel appears inside its ribcage, severing heart, lungs, and major vessels simultaneously.

It drops without a sound. No scream, no struggle—just instant termination.

"Target eliminated," Rhea reports with clinical precision. "Blink strike successful. Two contacts remaining. Drive showing amber status."

Kestra's final blink puts her directly in your path of retreat. "This way! The drives can't sustain rapid cycling—they'll overheat and potentially rupture."

You follow her tactical positioning, the remaining antinatalists pursuing with relentless mechanical precision. But the blink drive has given you the seconds you needed—enough distance to reach the rocky outcropping where this training began.

"Quantum positioning systems," Kestra explains, breathing hard as she checks the blink drive's status indicators. She wipes the blood from her tactical knife with practiced efficiency. "Twenty meters maximum range, but that's enough to break any engagement on your terms. The blink strike—materializing with your weapon inside the target—is instant death. No defense, no counterplay, no survival."

She sheathes the blade, her expression grim. "But it costs more than standard positioning. Higher energy drain, increased quantum instability, greater risk of catastrophic failure. You get maybe two blink strikes per battery charge, versus a dozen standard repositioning jumps."

The device on her back glows amber, then red. "Overheated. Fifteen-minute cooldown before next use. That's the price of quantum tunneling—you can't spam it like a cheap trick."

"Extraordinary." Rhea murmurs through your interface.

Kestra studies you with those winter-grey eyes. "Not bad for a first encounter. Most people freeze up when reality starts folding. You kept moving, followed tactical direction, adapted to impossible circumstances." She almost smiles. "You might actually survive out here." The device in her hands has gone dark, its geometric patterns no longer shifting.

"The antinatalists?" you ask.

"Still down there. Still hunting." Kestra's expression hardens. "G.A.E.A.'s infected don't give up, don't get discouraged, don't stop. They'll search that area until they find another target or receive new optimization directives from the superintelligence."

She stands, shouldering her gear. "Which brings us to your next lesson: resource management. We need those medical supplies from the depot, but the window for safe retrieval has closed. Do we wait for another opportunity, find an alternative target, or develop a different tactical approach?"

"Analysis suggests multiple viable alternatives," Rhea reports. "But decision-making authority rests with human operators. I provide tactical assessment; you provide strategic judgment."

Kestra nods toward the distant mountains. "There's a settlement eight hours northeast of here. Yellowknife Station—two hundred survivors trying to stay hidden from G.A.E.A.'s optimization protocols. They trade resources, information, and sanctuary to expedition teams."

She pauses, letting the weight of decision settle on your shoulders. "Or we can try a different approach to that depot. Your call."

The choice feels heavier than it should. Like the difference between safety and growth, between survival and living.

"What do you recommend?" you ask.

Kestra's smile is sharp as a blade. "I recommend you start thinking like someone who wants to be alive tomorrow. Because that antinatalist patrol just learned there are evolved humans operating in this sector. They'll report back to G.A.E.A.'s network, and the superintelligence will adjust its optimization parameters accordingly."

"In other words," Rhea adds with dry British humor, "your presence has been noted by a cosmic-scale intelligence that views human survival as an ecological inefficiency. How delightfully encouraging."

You look toward the mountains, then back at the valley where inhuman hunters continue their search. The weight of choice settles on your shoulders like armor—heavy, necessary, and yours to bear.

"Welcome to the post-collapse world," Kestra says. "Where every decision is life or death, and every victory costs more than you want to pay."

The wind carries distant roars from the valley below. Somewhere in the ruins, patient hunters wait for your return.

Your real education has begun.

## The Price of Living

[**This section would continue based on player choice—leading to either:**
- **Settlement Introduction**: Learning about human communities, trade, and social dynamics
- **Tactical Combat**: Advanced engagement with better preparation and AI coordination
- **Exploration/Stealth**: Alternative approaches to resource acquisition]

The story branches here based on player agency, but the core elements remain:
- Partnership with Rhea AI providing tactical augmentation
- Quantum technology integration (blink drives) as game-changing tools
- The constant pressure of G.A.E.A.'s optimization agenda
- Enhanced human capabilities that feel earned rather than arbitrary
- Choices that matter for character development and playstyle

The Pierce Brown influence shows in:
- Visceral, kinetic action sequences
- Characters defined through violence and choice under pressure
- Technology that feels both alien and grounded in physics
- Moral complexity without clear heroes or villains
- Prose that cuts like a blade—sharp, efficient, brutal when necessary
