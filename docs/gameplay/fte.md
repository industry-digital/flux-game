# Character Creation

> You find yourself in a strange place. Surrounding you is the vastness of a place not unlike the Mongolian steppe. The air is crisp and the sky is clear. You look around and see a small group of people standing nearby -- wielding all manner of primitive weapons, and wearing apparel unlike anything you've ever seen before.

> Suddenly, one of the women, wearing a patchwork of furs and leather, turns to you. Slung across her back is a shortbow made of a strange assembly of metal, wood, bone, and leather. Her gaze is piercing, like the eyes of a hawk, but her voice is warm and inviting.

> "Aha! You've come at just the right time. We've been waiting for you."  She extends her hand to you. "My name is Freyja. Come, let me introduce you to the others."

> You take her hand and she pulls you to your feet. She is surprisingly strong -- almost too strong. The world feels different somehow -- your body moves with surprising grace and power, and your mind feels sharper than you remember it being.

> "First things first," Freyja says, adjusting her quiver. "You'll need to know how to move around. Try typing 'north' to head toward that cluster of tents."

[Player types: north]

> You walk north across the grass, followed by Freyja. The encampment is larger than it first appeared -- dozens of hide tents arranged in a rough circle, with people moving between them carrying tools, weapons, and supplies.

> "Good," Freyja nods approvingly. "You can use 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west' -- or just 'n', 's', 'e', 'w' if you prefer. Now, let's meet Cross."

> A massive man steps out from behind a tent. His arms are like tree trunks, scarred from countless battles, and he carries a war hammer that looks like it could crush stone. But his eyes are intelligent, calculating.

> "Another one, eh?" Cross rumbles, looking you up and down. "Tell me, newcomer -- when the moment comes to fight, what feels right to you?"

> Cross crosses his arms. "Do you rely on raw **power** to overwhelm your enemies? Do you trust **finesse** to outmaneuver them? Or do you depend on **resilience** to outlast whatever they throw at you?"

> "Think carefully," he adds. "Your answer will help us understand how you move through this dangerous world."

> 1. Power
> 2. Finesse
> 3. Resilience

[Player chooses: power, finesse, or resilience]

> Freyja nods thoughtfully at your choice. "Interesting. Cross has a good eye for these things." She gestures for you to follow her. "Come, let's go south to the edge of camp. There's someone I want you to meet."

> "To talk to someone, just type 'say' followed by what you want to say. Or you can use 'tell' followed by their name if you want to speak to someone specific. Try it now -- say hello to me."

[Player types: say Hello, Freyja]

> "Hello, Freyja," you say.

> Freyja smiles. "Perfect. Now, let's continue south."

[Player types: s]

> You walk south to the edge of the encampment, where the tents give way to open steppe. Here, a figure sits cross-legged on a small rise, looking out over the vast grassland. As you approach, you realize it's a person of indeterminate age, with weathered skin and eyes that seem to hold decades of hard-won wisdom.

> "This is Sage," Freyja says quietly. "They've been out here longer than any of us. They understand things about this world that the rest of us are still learning."

> Sage turns to look at you, and you feel as if those eyes can see straight through you. "Another wanderer finds their way to us," they say in a voice like wind through grass. "The question is: what kind of wanderer are you?"

> Sage stands slowly, their movements fluid despite their apparent age. "In this world, survival depends not just on strength or knowledge, but on how your mind works. I've seen many come and go, and I've learned to recognize the patterns."

> "Tell me," Sage says, stepping closer, "when you need to understand something -- truly understand it -- what serves you best?"

> "Do you rely on being **perceptive** -- seeing the details others miss, noticing the subtle signs that reveal hidden truths? Or do you trust your **intelligence** -- analyzing, reasoning, working through problems with raw cognitive power?"

> Sage's weathered face shows the ghost of a smile. "Or perhaps you possess **force of will** -- the mental fortitude to push through when others would break, the determination to continue when all seems lost?"

> "Each path has kept people alive out here. Which feels most natural to you?"

[Player chooses: perceptive, intelligent, or force of will]

> Sage nods slowly. "I see. The mind reveals itself in many ways." They exchange a meaningful look with Freyja. "There's one more person you should meet before we continue."

> "Let's head west," Freyja suggests. "Thane will want to meet you."

[Player types: w]

> You walk west toward a quieter part of the camp, where a lone figure sits beside a small fire. The person is lean and weathered, with scars that tell stories of countless close calls. They look up as you approach, and their eyes seem to assess you in a single glance.

> "This is Thane," Freyja says. "They've survived longer than most of us. They have a gift for seeing what makes people... special."

> Thane stands with fluid grace. "Another wanderer finds their way to us," they say in a voice like gravel. "Everyone who survives in this world has something that sets them apart. Some natural advantage that's kept them alive when others fell."

> "What is it about you?" Thane asks, studying you intently. "What gift were you born with?"

> "Are you a **tinkerer** -- naturally drawn to understand how mechanical things work? Or **analytical** -- your mind cuts through problems like a blade through silk?"

> "Perhaps you have **ironguts** -- poisons and toxins that would fell others barely affect you? Or are you **innocuous** -- able to move through the world without drawing attention?"

> "Maybe you're **astute** -- nothing escapes your notice, you see things others miss? Or **lightfooter** -- naturally agile, moving with quiet grace?"

> "Could it be **nighteye** -- the darkness holds fewer secrets from you than most? Or **charismatic** -- people naturally trust you, want to follow you?"

> Thane's scarred face shows the hint of a smile. "Or perhaps you're **hardened** -- your body and mind are tougher than most, able to endure what would break others?"

> "Choose wisely. Your natural gifts will serve you well in the trials ahead."

> 1. Tinkerer
> 2. Analytical
> 3. Ironguts
> 4. Innocuous
> 5. Astute
> 6. Lightfooter
> 7. Nighteye
> 8. Charismatic
> 9. Hardened

[Player chooses: tinkerer, analytical, ironguts, innocuous, astute, lightfooter, nighteye, charismatic, or hardened]

> Thane nods approvingly. "Yes, I can see it in you now. That will serve you well." They turn toward a collection of gear laid out on hide mats. "Now, let me give you what you'll need to survive out there."

> Thane studies you carefully, taking in your choices. "Cross saw how you fight, Sage understood how you think, and I see what makes you unique. Together, this tells me exactly what you'll need."

> [Based on player's combat style, mental properties, and natural trait, Thane provides appropriate starting equipment]

> "This gear has been chosen specifically for you," Thane says, handing you the items. "It matches your strengths and will serve you well in the challenges ahead."

> They exchange a meaningful look with Freyja. "Now you're ready for what comes next."

> Freyja steps forward, adjusting her shortbow. "Our stores are running low, and winter approaches. It's time you learned how we survive out here." She gestures toward the vast steppe stretching beyond the camp. "Every able person must contribute to the group's survival."

> "Come," she says, her voice taking on a more serious tone. "I'm taking you on your first hunt. You'll learn to track, to kill, and to bring food back to feed our people. It's not just about survival - it's about proving you belong here."

> Freyja looks directly at you, her expression grave. "But be warned. The world holds more dangers than just the animals we hunt. There are others out there - humans who have been... changed. They see any human community as a threat to be eliminated."

> "Stay close to me, watch everything I do, and be ready to fight for your life. Your real education in this world begins now."

> [The First Time Experience begins with the hunting expedition...]

# FTE

## The First Hunt

> Freyja leads you east from the camp, her movements silent and purposeful. The morning air is crisp, and you can see your breath in small puffs as you follow her across the arid steppe toward the distant grasslands.

> "This is where we begin," she says, stopping at the edge of the grasslands. "See how the ground changes here? The soil is richer, the grass taller. Different animals live in different places. You must learn to read the land."

> She kneels down, examining tracks in the soft earth. "Wild horses pass through here regularly. But we're not hunting them today - too dangerous, too fast. We're after something smaller, easier for a first hunt."

> "Use 'look' to examine your surroundings more carefully. Try it now."

[Player types: look]

> You are standing at the edge of vast grasslands. The steppe behind you is brown and windswept, but ahead the grass grows thick and green. You can see game trails cutting through the vegetation, and in the distance, the dark line of a forest.

> Your equipment feels solid and reassuring in your hands. Freyja watches you approvingly.

> "Good. Now, follow me east into the grasslands. Stay low and move quietly. Type 'east' to continue."

[Player types: east]

> You move into the grasslands, the tall grass brushing against your legs. The change in environment is immediate - the air feels more humid, and you can hear the subtle sounds of small creatures moving through the undergrowth.

> Freyja holds up a hand, signaling you to stop. "Listen," she whispers. "Do you hear that?"

> In the distance, you can hear the soft lowing of cattle - or something like cattle. Freyja's eyes narrow as she studies the sound.

> "Auroch," she says quietly. "Wild cattle. Descended from the herds that escaped during the collapse. They're perfect for what we need - large enough to feed many people, but not so dangerous that they'll kill us."

> "But first, we need to get closer. The forest ahead provides better cover for stalking. Continue east toward the treeline."

[Player types: east]

> You approach the edge of the forest, where the grasslands give way to towering trees. The canopy creates a natural shelter, and the sounds of the grasslands fade behind you. Here, everything feels more enclosed, more intimate.

> Freyja moves like a shadow between the trees, her bow ready. "This is where the real hunt begins," she whispers. "The auroch graze in the clearings deeper in the forest. We'll track them, get close, and you'll make the kill."

> "Remember your training. Your choices back at camp - how you fight, how you think, what makes you unique - all of that matters now. Use 'north' to move deeper into the forest."

[Player types: north]

> You move deeper into the forest, following Freyja through the dappled shadows. The trees here are ancient, their trunks massive and gnarled. Sunlight filters through the canopy in scattered beams.

> Suddenly, Freyja freezes. Through the trees ahead, you can see a clearing where several large, shaggy beasts graze peacefully. The auroch are magnificent - larger than any cattle you might have imagined, with curved horns and thick, dark fur.

> "There," Freyja breathes. "Choose your target carefully. The smaller one on the left - that's your mark. Get as close as you can, then strike fast and clean."

> "Type 'hunt auroch' when you're ready to begin the attack."

[Player types: hunt auroch]

> You move carefully through the undergrowth, your equipment serving you well. [The specific mechanics here depend on the player's earlier choices - their combat style, mental properties, and natural traits all affect how the hunt plays out.]

> The auroch falls cleanly, and Freyja nods approvingly. "Well done. This meat will feed our people for days. Now we need to-"

> Her words are cut off by a sound that makes your blood run cold. A human voice, calling out from the shadows in a tone that sounds wrong somehow - too calm, too emotionless.

> "Breeders," the voice says. "Threatening the balance. Must be eliminated."

> Three figures step out from behind the trees. They look human, but something is terribly wrong with them. Their movements are too coordinated, too purposeful. Their eyes hold no warmth, no humanity.

> Freyja's bow is already in her hands. "Antinatalists," she hisses. "Cordyceps gaeatrix. They're not human anymore. They can't be reasoned with, can't be negotiated with."

> "Fight or die. There's no other choice."

> The first antinatalist raises a crude spear, moving with inhuman precision. Your real test begins now.

[Combat encounter begins...]

## After the Fight

> The last antinatalist falls, its body twitching once before going still. The forest seems to exhale, as if the very trees were holding their breath during the violence. Freyja lowers her bow, her breathing steady despite the intensity of the encounter.

> "Well fought," she says, studying you with new respect. "Your choices back at camp served you well. Not everyone survives their first encounter with the infected."

> She wipes her blade clean on a patch of moss, then turns to the auroch carcass. The animal is magnificent even in death - easily three hundred pounds of meat that could feed the camp for days. But you're deep in the forest, hours from home, and the scent of blood will attract predators.

> "You might be wondering," Freyja says, reaching into her pack, "how do we get this auroch back home?"

> She pulls out a device unlike anything you've ever seen. It's black metal, no bigger than her fist, with geometric patterns that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. The surface looks almost liquid, as if it's constantly moving despite being solid. But what catches your attention are the quartz crystals embedded in its surface - dozens of them, each no larger than a fingernail, arranged in precise geometric patterns that pulse with faint inner light.

> "This," she says, holding it up so you can see, "is a spacefold device. Pre-collapse technology that most people think is mythology. But it's real, and it's about to save us hours of dangerous travel."

> Freyja studies the device carefully, running her fingers over its surface. The quartz crystals respond to her touch, flickering with deeper luminescence. "Watch closely. Each device is quantum-entangled with a single location - in this case, our camp. The crystals maintain the entanglement bridge. It can only take us home, nowhere else. The process is... dramatic."

> She raises the device, and immediately the air around her begins to shimmer and distort.

> "Stand back," she warns.

> The world around Freyja begins to ripple like water disturbed by a stone. But this isn't water - this is space itself, and something is pulling it taut. The distortion spreads outward in waves, and you watch in horrified fascination as reality begins to fold.

> The trees behind Freyja stretch and warp, then seem to bend inward as if invisible hands are gathering up the corners of existence like a bedsheet. Through the distortion, you can see... elsewhere. The familiar tents and fires of your camp, sharp and clear as if it's right there in the forest with you.

> The device in Freyja's hand pulses with dark light, and the quartz crystals begin to resonate with harmonic frequencies that you can feel in your bones. The geometric patterns on its surface writhe and shift, and the crystals flare with brilliant white light as they channel quantum energy through their lattice structures. The air screams - reality itself crying out as something fundamental is violated.

> Then comes the puncture.

> Space doesn't tear gently. It ruptures with a sound like breaking glass amplified a thousandfold. A ragged hole appears in the air itself, its edges sparking and writhing as if the universe is trying to heal the wound. Through it, you can see the camp as clearly as if you could reach out and touch it.

> "Help me with the auroch," Freyja says calmly, as if reality-tearing holes in space are perfectly normal. "The fold won't hold for long."

> Together, you drag the massive carcass toward the impossible doorway. The hole in space crackles with energy, its edges unstable and wrong. But through it, you can see people from your camp looking back at you with expressions of wonder and relief.

> "After you," Freyja says. "Step through. One moment you're here, the next you're home."

> You hesitate at the threshold, looking into the torn space. This is impossible. This violates everything you thought you knew about the world.

> "Trust me," Freyja says. "The technology is ancient, but reliable. Step through."

[Player steps through the spacefold]

> One moment you're standing in the forest, the next your foot touches familiar ground. The transition is seamless, impossible - a single step that brings you instantly back to the safety of camp.

> Freyja follows, hauling the auroch through the fold. The moment she's clear, the device pulses once more, the quartz crystals flaring with one final burst of light before dimming to their previous faint glow. The fold collapses.

> The hole snaps shut with a thunderclap that reverberates through the camp. The forest vanishes. The only evidence of what you've witnessed is the acrid smell of ozone, the perfect circle of melted grass where the device's energy touched the ground, and the faint harmonic resonance still echoing in the quartz crystals.

> "Welcome home," Freyja says, pocketing the device. "You've just completed your first successful expedition. The auroch will feed us well, and you've proven you can survive in this world."

> "Rest now. Tomorrow, your real education begins."
