# Fundamental Properties of the World

For all intents and purposes, the physical laws of the world are the same as on Planet Earth. That means, specifically:

- Gravity is the same. Things fall when dropped.
- Everything that an actor can interact with has mass.

## Properties We Choose to Ignore

- Volume. Mass is the only property that matters in our MUD.
