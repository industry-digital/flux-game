# FSP: Factions

Here we present a summary of the various well-known "factions" in the FSP universe.

We use the term "faction" loosely, and it can refer to a group of actors, a group of organizations, or a group of organizations that tend to ally with each other

## Raiders

The term "Raiders" encompasses dozens of fragmented groups of desperate survivors - both baseline and evolved humans - who have abandoned community-based survival in favor of predatory nomadism. United only by their willingness to prey on other survivors, these poorly-equipped groups constantly war against each other while scraping by in the most dangerous territories.

### The Fragmented Reality

Raiders represent the antithesis of cooperative survival. Rather than building sustainable communities or developing specialized knowledge, they survive by taking what others have gathered. This parasitic existence creates a perpetual state of internal conflict as Raider groups compete for the same scarce resources and territories.

**No Unified Command**: Despite sharing similar survival strategies, Raider groups maintain fierce independence. Temporary alliances form around specific targets but dissolve immediately after successful raids. Trust between groups remains impossible when everyone operates on the principle of taking what they need.

**Territorial Conflicts**: Raider groups establish loose territories around promising scavenging areas - ruins with accessible resources, routes between survivor communities, or spillover zones from G.A.E.A.'s protected territories. These territories overlap constantly, creating endless skirmishes over access rights and salvage claims.

**Resource Competition**: Every successful community raid or resource discovery triggers conflicts between multiple Raider groups. Success breeds aggression as groups fight to claim the spoils, often destroying more value than they gain through their conflicts.

### Survival Through Predation

**Opportunistic Targeting**: Raiders prey on vulnerable targets using surprise, numbers, and desperate brutality rather than superior equipment. They prefer isolated settlements, damaged expeditions, or solo travelers who cannot effectively resist their crude weapons and coordinated attacks.

**Ambush Tactics**: Raider groups monitor routes between communities from concealed positions, striking when targets appear weakened or distracted. These attacks focus on quick smash-and-grab operations before organized resistance can form or help can arrive.

**Scavenger Intimidation**: Raiders drive off other scavengers through threats and violence, claiming salvage territories through fear rather than capability. They rely on their willingness to fight over scraps that other survivors might abandon rather than risk injury.

### Crude Equipment and Desperation

**Improvised Weapons**: Raiders fight with salvaged pre-collapse weapons, makeshift clubs, sharpened metal scraps, and crude explosive devices. Their equipment consists of whatever they can scavenge, steal, or cobble together from ruins. Most weapons are unreliable and jury-rigged to function.

**Survival Equipment**: Raider gear focuses on basic survival needs - patched clothing, improvised armor from scrap metal and leather, crude tools for breaking into buildings and containers. Everything is repaired with whatever materials are available, creating a patchwork appearance.

**No Advanced Technology**: Raiders lack access to shell technology, advanced power systems, or sophisticated equipment. They operate as baseline or poorly-equipped evolved humans, relying on numbers, surprise, and willingness to take risks that other survivors avoid.

### Internal Warfare Dynamics

**Escalation Cycles**: Conflicts between Raider groups follow predictable escalation patterns. Initial resource disputes expand into territorial wars as groups seek to eliminate competition permanently. These conflicts often spiral beyond rational cost-benefit analysis.

**Leadership Instability**: Raider groups suffer constant leadership challenges as successful raids create internal competition for authority. Leadership changes through combat challenges, betrayal, and simple abandonment when groups split over strategic disagreements.

**Alliance Betrayal**: Temporary alliances between Raider groups inevitably collapse through betrayal, resource disputes, or leadership conflicts. The expectation of betrayal becomes self-fulfilling as groups prepare for inevitable conflict with their temporary partners.

### G.A.E.A. Territory Operations

**Margin Scavenging**: Raiders are largely excluded from G.A.E.A.'s protected territories due to their lack of advanced equipment. They operate in the outermost spillover zones, competing for the most basic resources that escape superintelligence control - often scraps that other survivors consider too dangerous or worthless to pursue.

**High Casualty Operations**: Without shell technology or sophisticated equipment, Raider groups suffer catastrophic losses when they venture too close to predator territories. Most attempts to access valuable resources result in the complete loss of expedition teams to apex predators.

**Desperate Risk-Taking**: Raiders accept suicidal odds because they have no alternative survival strategies. Their willingness to enter territories that kill most intruders occasionally yields valuable discoveries, but more often results in the elimination of entire groups.

### The Raider Economy

**Theft-Based Resource Cycle**: The Raider economy depends entirely on resource extraction from other survivors. This creates an unsustainable system where the total resource pool constantly diminishes through conflict waste and equipment destruction.

**Equipment Scavenging**: Raider groups strip equipment from defeated enemies and abandoned sites, creating a secondary economy of salvaged gear. However, their lack of technical knowledge means most complex technology is destroyed during crude extraction attempts or rendered useless through improper handling.

**Information Trading**: Despite mutual hostility, Raider groups sometimes trade tactical information about community defenses, expedition routes, and resource discoveries. This information economy represents the only sustainable exchange between competing groups.

### Why Raiders Persist

**Failed Community Members**: Many Raiders are survivors who couldn't adapt to community life - individuals who lacked the cooperation skills, technical knowledge, or psychological stability required for group survival. Raider gangs become refuges for those rejected by or incompatible with organized communities.

**Community Rejection**: Some Raiders are survivors who were exiled from communities for various offenses. Unable to return to cooperative survival, they adopt predatory lifestyles out of necessity rather than choice.

**Philosophical Opposition**: Certain Raiders reject community-based survival on ideological grounds, viewing cooperative strategies as weakness or believing that only individual excellence deserves survival in the post-collapse world.

### The Raider Threat

For established survivor communities, Raiders represent a persistent but manageable external threat. Unlike G.A.E.A.'s overwhelming predator enforcement, Raider attacks can be defended against with proper preparation, though their unpredictable timing and desperate tactics make them dangerous to isolated or vulnerable targets.

The fragmented nature of Raider groups makes diplomatic solutions impossible - defeating one group provides no protection against others, and temporary truces mean nothing when leadership changes through violence. However, communities with shell technology and organized defenses can usually repel Raider attacks, making these groups more of a nuisance than an existential threat to well-prepared settlements.
