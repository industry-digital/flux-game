# FSP World Concept: Healers

In the world of FSP, [combat](./combat-system.md) takes place in a world where [ghosts](./core-shell.md) are the protagonists. Ghosts are the "saviors" of humanity, venturing deep into the dangerous world created by GAEA, collecting resources on the margins of a deadly, lush paradise. They are digital consciousness inserted into "shells" -- bionic bodies that are the physical manifestation of their consciousness.

The "expedition" is a group of ghosts collaborating to venture deep into the wilderness to find post-Collapse ruins. Within are the wonders of a past civilization, and the secrets that may save humanity.

## Rejecting the Healer Class: Why Mandatory Roles Undermine Genuine Cooperation

### The Fundamental Problem with Traditional Healers

The healer class represents one of the most intellectually lazy design patterns in multiplayer gaming. Rather than fostering authentic cooperation, it creates artificial dependency through mechanical necessity.

**The Forced Dependency Problem**: Traditional healer design mandates that groups *must* include specific roles to survive. This creates:
- Rigid group composition requirements that eliminate tactical flexibility
- Player frustration when desired roles are unavailable
- Artificial scarcity that gates access to core game content
- Shallow cooperation based on mechanical necessity rather than emergent strategy

**The Agency Elimination**: When healing becomes a class monopoly, individual players lose the fundamental ability to take responsibility for their own survival. Self-reliance becomes impossible by design.

### Flux's Alternative: Distributed Competence and Authentic Choice

In Flux's post-collapse world, survival depends on **distributed competence** rather than specialized dependency. Every core can develop survival skills, but mastery requires investment, resources, and demonstrated capability under pressure.

**Universal Basic Competence**: All cores can perform essential survival functions:
- Basic first aid to stabilize injuries
- Simple shell component maintenance
- Environmental hazard protection
- Emergency medical procedures

**Specialization Through Investment**: Advanced medical capability emerges from:
- Skill development through practice and study
- Resource investment in quality tools and supplies
- Knowledge acquisition about anatomy and shell technology
- Demonstrated competence under pressure

**Meaningful Choice Architecture**: Players choose their level of medical investment based on:
- Group composition and strategic needs
- Available resources and training opportunities
- Personal interest in medical gameplay mechanics
- Risk assessment for planned operations

### The Cooperation Paradox

Flux creates stronger cooperation by making it **optional rather than mandatory**:

**Organic Interdependence**: When medical expertise provides genuine advantage but isn't strictly required, cooperation emerges from strategic value rather than mechanical compulsion.

**Redundant Capability**: Multiple group members can provide medical support at different competence levels, creating tactical flexibility rather than single points of failure.

**Teaching and Learning**: Medical specialists can share knowledge with teammates, gradually reducing group dependency while strengthening individual capability.

**Resource Sharing**: Medical supplies and tools become shared expedition resources, creating economic cooperation without role dependency.

### Design Philosophy: Agency Over Dependency

The rejection of healer classes reflects Flux's core commitment to player agency and authentic challenge:

**Self-Reliance Capability**: Every player can take responsibility for their own survival, making group participation a strategic choice rather than a survival necessity.

**Skill Expression**: Medical competence becomes demonstrable player ability rather than character sheet statistics or magical powers.

**Resource Management**: Healing requires actual materials and tools that must be found, maintained, and allocated strategically.

**Time and Risk**: Medical procedures require investment of precious action time and create vulnerability windows, making timing and positioning critical.

**Authentic Consequences**: Poor medical decisions lead to realistic outcomes rather than arbitrary failure states designed around class balance.

## Survival Systems That Replace Healer Dependency

### Sacrificial Armor: Protection Through Resource Expenditure

One of the primary systems that enables survival without mandatory healers is Flux's [sacrificial armor](./armor.md) architecture. Rather than requiring constant healing to offset damage, armor provides **finite protection that degrades through use**.

**The Anti-Healer Philosophy**: Sacrificial armor allows players to survive dangerous encounters by expending protective resources rather than requiring another player to restore health. This transforms survival from a social dependency into a resource management challenge.

**Strategic Protection Management**: Players must decide:
- Which armor components to sacrifice to protect critical shell systems
- When to expose damaged armor to absorb hits meant for functional components
- How to allocate limited high-quality protective gear across expedition members
- Whether to continue operations with compromised protection or withdraw for maintenance

**Finite Resource Economics**: Unlike magical healing that restores health from nothing, armor protection must be:
- Scavenged from dangerous ruins or crafted from limited materials
- Maintained through skilled labor and specialized tools
- Replaced when sacrificed beyond repair
- Shared strategically among community members

This creates **authentic cooperative economics** where group members share protective resources based on mission needs and individual contribution, rather than being forced to include specific player classes for survival.

## Between-Combat Medical Systems: Time as the Ultimate Healer

### No Instant Recovery Mechanics

Flux fundamentally rejects instant healing mechanics that define traditional MMORPGs:

**No Health Potions**: There are no magical consumables that instantly restore health during combat. Injury consequences persist until proper medical attention can be administered.

**No Stimpaks**: Unlike science fiction games with instant medical injectors, Flux requires actual time and care for injury treatment.

**No Combat Healing Spells**: Medical procedures cannot be performed during active engagement - they require safety, time, and proper conditions.

**No Regeneration Mechanics**: Shell components and core consciousness don't automatically heal over time without intervention.

### Medical Treatment Requires Security

All meaningful medical care occurs **between combat encounters** when tactical safety allows proper procedures:

**Secure Environment Requirement**: Medical procedures demand protection from interruption. Teams must establish defensive positions or withdraw to safe areas before treatment begins.

**Time Investment**: Effective medical care requires significant time commitment - from minutes for basic first aid to hours for complex shell component repair.

**Vulnerability Windows**: During medical procedures, both patient and caregiver become vulnerable to external threats, requiring team coordination for security.

**Equipment Dependency**: Medical procedures require specific tools, supplies, and workspace that cannot be deployed during active combat.

### Authentic Medical Procedures

Between-combat medical care follows realistic treatment principles rather than magical convenience:

#### Anatomical Damage Assessment
```
> examine patient
[Left arm: 23% integrity | Multiple kinetic impacts]
[Torso: 67% integrity | Thermal damage, sealed]
[Head: 89% integrity | Minor sensor array damage]
[Critical Priority: Left arm requires immediate attention]
```

#### Staged Treatment Protocols
**Triage**: Assess multiple injuries and prioritize treatment based on severity and available resources
**Stabilization**: Prevent further degradation of critical injuries while preparing for comprehensive treatment
**Surgical Intervention**: Address complex damage requiring precision tools and extended procedure time
**Recovery Monitoring**: Ensure treatment effectiveness and watch for complications

#### Resource-Dependent Outcomes
**Tool Quality**: Precision surgical instruments enable better outcomes than improvised medical gear
**Skill Level**: Experienced medical specialists achieve superior results with identical resources
**Supply Availability**: Advanced treatments require rare medications, specialized components, or sterile environments
**Environmental Factors**: Clean, well-lit surgical areas produce better outcomes than field conditions

### The Strategic Medical Layer

Between-combat medical systems create strategic depth beyond immediate survival:

#### Expedition Planning
**Medical Specialist Inclusion**: Teams must decide whether to include dedicated medical expertise for extended operations
**Supply Load Planning**: Medical equipment and consumables compete with other expedition necessities for limited carrying capacity
