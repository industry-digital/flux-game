# Item Quality System

In Flux, everything degrades. The flowers you pick today are less potent tomorrow. The rifle you maintain carefully stays effective longer than one you neglect. Quality isn't a fixed label - it's a living measurement that changes as the world acts on your possessions.

## Quality as a Living Scale

Every item has a quality score from 0 to 100 that constantly shifts based on time, use, and environmental conditions. Unlike games where you find "Legendary Sword +5" and keep it forever, your gear is always fighting against entropy.

**Quality Scale:**
- **0-20**: Barely functional junk, breaks easily, unreliable
- **21-40**: Poor condition but usable, significant limitations
- **41-60**: Decent, reliable for everyday use
- **61-80**: High quality, performs well, noticeable advantages
- **81-100**: Exceptional performance, masterwork level, rare to maintain

## Quality as a Logistic Curve

Quality does not simply increase or decrease linearly. It follows a logistic curve, where the rate of change slows as the item approaches its maximum potential in either direction.

This makes perfect quality mathematically impossible to achieve. Likewise perfect degradation is also impossible. 


## The Three Forces That Shape Quality

Behind every quality score are three factors that constantly change:

**Material Grade (M)** - How good the raw stuff is
- The purity of metal, density of wood, strength of fibers
- Pre-collapse components start much higher than scavenged materials
- Doesn't change once made, but determines how high quality can go

**Craftsmanship (C)** - How skillfully it was made
- Builder's expertise, tool quality, time spent on details
- Set when created, can only improve through major rework
- Determines how well the item performs at any condition level

**Condition (D)** - How beat up it is right now
- The only factor that constantly changes
- Drops from use, weather exposure, neglect
- Can be restored through maintenance, but never beyond original limits

**Quality Score = Average of (M, C, D)**

## How Degradation Actually Works

**Time Decay**
- Fresh herbs lose potency within days
- Metal tools slowly accumulate microscopic damage
- Wooden items dry out and crack in heat, swell and warp in humidity

**Use Degradation**
- Every shot fired, every swing taken, every mile walked
- Some items degrade faster under stress (weapons in combat)
- Delicate items (electronics, optics) degrade faster than simple tools

**Environmental Pressure**
- Rain rusts metal, rots organic materials
- Heat makes plastics brittle, warps wood
- Dust clogs mechanisms, salt corrodes everything
- Storms can damage multiple items at once

**Example: Master's Bow Over Time**
- Day 1: Quality 88 (Materials 85, Craft 90, Condition 90)
- Week 1: Quality 84 (Condition drops to 82 from practice use)
- Month 1: Quality 79 (Condition 68 after humid weather and heavy use)
- Month 3: Quality 71 (Condition 52, needs maintenance or continues declining)

## Maintenance and Recovery

**Cleaning and Basic Care**
- Removes dirt, moisture, prevents immediate damage
- Can restore 5-15 quality points if done regularly
- Requires simple materials: oil, cloth, basic tools

**Skilled Repair**
- Fixes actual damage: resharpening, part replacement, refinishing
- Can restore more quality but requires expertise and materials
- Limited by original Material Grade and Craftsmanship

**The Maintenance Ceiling**
- You can never restore quality above the lowest of Material Grade or Craftsmanship
- A masterwork sword (M85, C90) can be maintained up to 85 quality
- A crude knife (M30, C25) can never exceed 25 quality no matter how much care

## Quality Effects on Performance

Higher quality items don't just "do more damage" - they perform better in multiple ways:

**Weapons**
- **Damage**: Higher quality means more consistent, effective strikes
- **Accuracy**: Better craftsmanship improves precision and handling
- **Reliability**: Low condition causes misfires, jams, breakage
- **Durability**: High material grade resists further degradation

**Tools**
- **Efficiency**: Quality tools work faster and with less effort
- **Precision**: Better tools enable finer, more complex work
- **Lifespan**: Quality tools last longer under heavy use

**Consumables**
- **Potency**: Fresh herbs are more medicinally effective
- **Shelf Life**: Higher quality materials resist spoilage longer
- **Effectiveness**: Quality reagents produce better results

## Finding and Making Quality Items

**Scavenged Gear**
- Usually starts with decent materials but terrible condition
- Pre-collapse items can have amazing materials (80-95) but awful condition (10-30)
- Wilderness finds have variable materials based on environmental conditions

**Crafted Items**
- Condition starts high (80-95) since it's brand new
- Craftsmanship depends entirely on your skill and tools
- Materials depend on what you can find or trade for

**The Quality Hunt**
- Finding high-grade materials becomes a strategic goal
- Weather timing affects material quality for organic resources
- Urban exploration seeks pre-collapse precision components
- Trading networks become vital for specialized materials

## Living With Degradation

**Strategic Decisions**
- Use your best gear when it matters most
- Save high-quality consumables for critical moments
- Balance maintenance costs against replacement options
- Plan around the weather to protect vulnerable equipment

**The Quality Spiral**
- Good gear enables better resource gathering
- Better resources enable higher quality crafting
- Higher quality tools last longer and work better
- But everything constantly fights against entropy

**No Permanent Solutions**
- Even the best gear requires constant attention
- Quality management becomes a core survival skill
- The world never stops trying to break your stuff
- Success means staying ahead of the decay curve

## Examples in Practice

**Combat Rifle Evolution**
- Found: Quality 45 (Materials 85, Craft 70, Condition 15) - amazing potential, terrible state
- After cleaning: Quality 55 (Condition restored to 25)
- After expert repair: Quality 70 (Condition restored to 55, hitting material limit)
- After 100 shots: Quality 65 (Condition drops to 50 from use)
- After storm exposure: Quality 58 (Condition drops to 43 from moisture)

**Medicinal Herb Lifecycle**
- Fresh picked: Quality 85 (perfect materials, perfect condition)
- Day 2: Quality 78 (natural degradation begins)
- Day 5: Quality 65 (noticeable potency loss)
- Day 7: Quality 45 (still useful but much less effective)
- Day 10: Quality 20 (barely medicinal, mostly compost)

This system makes every item feel alive - constantly changing, requiring attention, creating meaningful decisions about when and how to use your precious resources. Nothing lasts forever, but skilled players can keep quality high through careful management and timely maintenance.
