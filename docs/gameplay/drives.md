# FSP Drives

In the world of FSP, there is a notion of a quantum-powered mechanical "drive" that actors can use to augment their base capabilities.

All drives are mounted on the *backpack* slot of the actor.

Only one kind of drive may be equipped at any time; no exceptions.

The three kinds of drives that exist are:

1. Skate Drive

This is a anti-gravity drive that connects to two "skates" attached to the actor's feet. The actor then uses his own power to propel himself forward while suspended in air. This drive requires a surface beneath it onto which the skates can exert anti-gravitational force. So it's like flying close to the ground, while skating around in air.

2. Inertial Drive

The inertial drive *reduces an actors effective mass* by varying degrees according to quality. What this enables:

- Supernatural ability to accelerate to top speed, and decelerate to a stop in a single step.
- Changes in direction while moving at top speed, without losing momentum

3. [Blink Drive](./blink.md)

This device consumes piezoelectric crystals to create a short-range, instant teleport having a range and "accuracy" that depends on the skill of the actor. This enables:

- Instant repositioning
- Interesting tactical options, like Blink Strike

```
The forest held its breath.

Maya crouched behind the massive oak, her neural interface painting threat assessments across her vision in cool blue overlays. Thirty meters ahead, the clearing stretched like an amphitheater of death—three Cordyceps worshippers arranged in a perfect triangle around the ancient stone marker that had once been a park monument. Now it was just another gravestone for the world that died.

The worshippers moved with the fluid, inhuman grace of the infected. Their eyes held the terrible clarity of those who had surrendered their futures to G.A.E.A.'s vision. One carried a military-grade plasma rifle. Another spun a vibro-blade in lazy arcs that hummed with lethal promise. The third stood motionless, hands empty, which made her the most dangerous of all.

Maya's fingers found the activation stud on her inertial drive.

The quantum field engaged with a whisper of displaced air, and suddenly she weighed less than shadow. The forest floor became a suggestion rather than an anchor. Her effective mass dropped to nearly nothing while her POW 85 frame retained every joule of its devastating potential.

Time to dance.

She burst from the treeline like a comet given flesh, her carbon-composite fauchard held low and deadly. The inertial drive's anti-gravity field lifted her just above the forest floor, skates engaging with the quantum-smoothed earth beneath. She moved like liquid mercury across broken terrain, flowing over fallen logs and scattered stones with impossible grace.

The first worshipper turned toward the sound of her approach—too late.

Maya's fauchard carved upward in a perfect arc, its monomolecular edge singing through air made thick with morning mist. The blade found the gap between helmet and body armor with surgical precision, enhanced by the momentum of her approach and the terrible leverage of her superhuman strength. Blood painted the ancient stone in arterial spray.

She didn't pause to watch him fall.

The plasma rifle tracked toward her, but Maya was already gone—her reduced mass allowing direction changes that mocked Newton's laws. She banked left around the monument, skates carving furrows in the earth as she rode the momentum like a wave of pure kinetic energy.

The second worshipper fired where she had been, superheated plasma turning a century oak into an exploding pillar of steam and splinters.

Maya's counterstrike came from an impossible angle. Her inertial drive let her decelerate from full speed to a dead stop in the space of a single step, then accelerate again perpendicular to her original vector. The fauchard's blade traced a silver line across the clearing, its carbon-composite shaft flexing like a whip as she brought the weapon around in a horizontal sweep that would have been impossible for someone constrained by normal mass.

The plasma rifle clattered to the ground in two pieces, along with the hands that had held it.

"Impossible," breathed the third worshipper, her voice carrying the hollow echo of the cordyceps neural restructuring.

Maya rose from her combat crouch, the inertial drive's field making her movements fluid as quicksilver. The fauchard's point tracked toward the remaining enemy with predatory focus.

"Nothing's impossible," Maya said, her voice carrying the quiet confidence of someone who had learned to dance with physics itself. "You just have to know which rules to break."

The final worshipper smiled with someone else's madness and charged.

Maya met her in the center of the clearing, where the morning light painted everything in shades of gold and crimson. Two superhuman forms collided with forces that shattered the ancient stone marker and sent tremors through the earth that sleeping giants might have envied.

When the dust settled, only Maya remained standing.

She deactivated the inertial drive, feeling weight return to her limbs like an old friend. The carbon-composite fauchard rested against her shoulder, its blade clean and gleaming in the forest light.

"Three down," she whispered to the trees that had witnessed humanity's twilight. "Only about ten thousand to go."

Somewhere in the distance, she could hear the approach of something large moving through the underbrush. G.A.E.A.'s enforcers, drawn by the sounds of combat.

Maya smiled and reactivated her drive.

Time to dance again.

*She was death given form and momentum given purpose, skating through a world that no longer belonged to her species but had not yet forgotten the terrible beauty of human excellence under impossible circumstances.*

*She was magnificent.*

*She was all that remained.*

*She was enough.*
