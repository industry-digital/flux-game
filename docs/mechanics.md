## Subjective Reality

In our simulation, when we talk about "reality," we refer to the subjective experience of each player. Each player perceives the world through their own lens, and their experiences are unique to them. This means that two players can interact with the same entities in the game, but their experiences and interpretations of those interactions may differ.

In a text-based game, subjective reality is fairly easy to implement because we only need to convince the mind's eye, and not
the physical eye. The game can present different descriptions, dialogues, and events to each player based on their unique experiences and choices.

### Examples

**Two players perceiving the same Place a bit differently:**

Player A: enters a room and sees two paragraphs of descriptive text about the Place.

  ```text
  [Base Description]
  You enter a dimly lit room. The air is thick with dust, and the faint smell of mildew lingers in the corners. A single flickering candle casts eerie shadows on the walls.
  [Emergent Narrative, Player A]
  You step into the room, and a chill runs down your spine. The shadows seem to dance around you, whispering secrets of the past. You can't shake the feeling that you're not alone. There is a rocking chair in the corner, and it seems to be swaying gently, as if someone had just left it.
  ```

Player B: enters the same room and sees a different set of descriptive text.

  ```text
  [Base Description]
  You enter a dimly lit room. The air is thick with dust, and the faint smell of mildew lingers in the corners. A single flickering candle casts eerie shadows on the walls.
  [Emergent Narrative, Player B]
  You step into the room, and a sense of nostalgia washes over you. The shadows remind you of your childhood home, where you used to play hide and seek in the dark corners.
  ```

Player A: tries to interact with the rocking chair in the emergent narrative.

  ```text

  [Player A]
  You approach the rocking chair, and as you reach out to touch it, it begins to rock back and forth on its own. The shadows seem to swirl around you, and you hear a faint whisper: "Help me."
  ```

Player A: "Hey, did you see that? The rocking chair just started moving on its own!"

Player B: "What rocking chair?"

Player A:
  ```text
  > REVEAL chair to B
  ```

Player B:
  ```text
  A points at a rocking chair in the corner, and it seems to be swaying gently, as if someone had just left it.
  ```
