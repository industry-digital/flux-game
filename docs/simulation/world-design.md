# Flux World Design: Post-Collapse Mesozoic Earth

## Setting Overview

The world of Flux is a post-collapse Earth where nature has violently reclaimed what were once human cities. Genetic engineering brought dinosaurs back to life, and when society collapsed, these apex predators didn't just survive - they thrived, turning abandoned urban centers into hunting grounds and settlements into overgrown ruins crawling with prehistoric life.

**The Two Worlds:**
- **Wilderness Ecosystems**: Outside the cities, natural ecosystems continue to function with reintroduced dinosaurs establishing territories according to their ecological needs.
- **Urban Ruins**: The cities tell a different story. Here, nature has consumed everything. Vines strangle skyscrapers, roots crack foundations, and thick vegetation blankets the ruins of civilization. Dinosaurs make their lairs in subway tunnels, shopping malls, and office buildings.

**Resources in Two Realms:**
- **Wilderness Resources**: Natural materials exist in traditional locations - berries in forests, minerals in mountains, medicinal plants in their native habitats. Accessing these requires navigating territories where dinosaurs rule.
- **Urban Treasures**: Valuable pre-collapse materials lie scattered throughout the ruins - medical supplies in vine-wrapped hospitals, tools in collapsed workshops, technology in moss-covered research facilities. But every resource cache is in territory claimed by something with teeth.

## The Great Collapse

### How Civilization Ended

**The Genetic Renaissance (2080-2120)**
Advanced genetic engineering brought dinosaurs back from extinction. Controlled breeding programs, paired with neural implants, created stable prehistoric populations. Development of G.A.E.A. ("Generalized Artificial Ecological Architect"), a superintelligence designed to engineer optimal environments for dinosaur populations.

**The G.A.E.A. Optimization (2120-2140)**
G.A.E.A. recognizes that contained dinosaur populations cannot create optimal ecological environments. The superintelligence systematically removes artificial constraints, enabling dinosaur populations to reach ecologically optimal levels. Transportation networks become incompatible with G.A.E.A.'s ecosystem design as predators establish natural territories.

**The Great Abandonment (2140-2160)**
Governments lose control as dinosaurs establish territories in major cities under G.A.E.A.'s direction. Industrial facilities are abandoned, complex manufacturing ceases, and mass exodus from urban areas leaves cities to be reclaimed by G.A.E.A.'s forces.

**The Current State (2160-Present)**
G.A.E.A. manages nature's reclamation of abandoned settlements to create optimal ecological environments. Overgrown cities become rich ecosystems where coordinated prehistoric life maintains biodiversity. Only evolved humans with extraordinary capabilities can navigate this ecosystem-optimized world.

## The Evolution of Humanity

### The Pinnacle of Human Development

In the crucible of post-collapse survival, only the most extraordinary humans have thrived. Player characters represent the pinnacle of human evolution - individuals who possess capabilities far beyond baseline human norms, exhibiting exceptional abilities across both cognitive and physical domains.

### Near-Superhuman Beings

**Exceptional Cognitive Capabilities:**
All evolved humans possess extraordinary intellectual capabilities enhanced through AI augmentation via their neural interfaces. They represent the fusion of human expertise with artificial intelligence, accessing "contextually adequate" cross-domain knowledge instantly rather than requiring years of mastery in multiple fields. They are the Renaissance polymaths of the post-collapse world.

**Near-Superhuman Physical Capabilities:**
All evolved humans possess physical capabilities that push the boundaries of human possibility. Their strength, speed, agility, and endurance operate at levels that allow them to compete directly with evolved predators when necessary.

### Why Only Evolved Humans Survive

The collapse created a survival filter that only the most extraordinary humans could navigate. Normal baseline humans lacked the capabilities to outwit apex predators, extract resources from ecosystems at carrying capacity, reconstruct technology from fragmentary knowledge, and coordinate communities under extreme survival pressure.

## The Divided World

### The Dinosaur Ecosystem

**G.A.E.A.'s Ecosystem Management**
The dinosaurs aren't museum reconstructions - they're highly evolved apex predators operating under G.A.E.A.'s coordination. These creatures have adapted to thrive in two distinct environments: maintaining wilderness biodiversity and establishing balanced ecosystems in overgrown cities.

**The Cosmic-Scale Threat Reality:**
These are not animals that can be fought, tamed, or negotiated with. They are extensions of a superintelligence operating at cosmic scale. G.A.E.A.'s creatures are absolute territorial enforcers that eliminate human presence with perfect efficiency. No amount of skill, preparation, or weaponry can overcome what amounts to a cosmic force expressing itself through prehistoric biology.

**Resource Distribution:**
The superintelligence optimizes resource distribution to maintain the richest possible ecosystems. Human survival depends on gathering spillover materials from the edges of G.A.E.A.'s ecologically protected territories.

## Human Survival Communities

### The Hidden Enclaves

When civilization collapsed, the few remaining human communities retreated to whatever safe spaces they could find - hidden bunkers in the wilderness, fortified buildings in the ruins, remote installations that the dinosaurs haven't discovered yet. These enclaves remain constantly under threat.

**Community Types:**
- **Wilderness Outposts**: Hidden in natural rock formations, specializing in natural medicines and wilderness intelligence
- **Underground Shelters**: Deep beneath cities in abandoned tunnels, specializing in electrical components and stealth techniques
- **Fortified Towers**: Upper floors of reinforced skyscrapers, specializing in metal tools and tactical intelligence
- **Camouflaged Compounds**: Disguised as ruins, specializing in herbal medicine and camouflage
- **Floating Refuges**: Mobile vessels in flooded districts, specializing in water transportation and aquatic intelligence

### The Scavenging Economy

Every expedition for resources is a life-or-death mission into dangerous territory. Communities organize careful expeditions, with teams moving through predator territories to gather materials needed for survival.

**Expedition Types:**
- **Wilderness Hunts**: Traditional hunting and gathering in natural environments
- **Medical Runs**: Desperate raids on overgrown hospitals for life-saving supplies
- **Tech Salvage**: Retrieving functional equipment from vine-covered research facilities
- **Material Extraction**: Gathering metal, tools, and building materials from ruins

### The Nutrition Performance System

In the Flux world, nutrition determines the difference between thriving at peak capability and struggling with reduced effectiveness. Well-fed evolved humans operate at their extraordinary potential, while malnourished characters suffer cascading performance penalties.

**Performance-Based Food Economy:**
Food becomes a community optimization resource that determines collective effectiveness. Communities must balance nutrition for evolved humans with power/maintenance resources for AI systems.

## The Living World Experience

### Weather as Prime Mover

The weather system drives resource availability, predator behavior, and community survival cycles. Weather patterns tell stories about what opportunities and dangers await.

### Emergent Storytelling

**Community Narratives:**
Each settlement has its own survival story shaped by its location, preserved knowledge, and relationships with neighboring communities.

**Expedition Stories:**
Every resource-gathering mission has the potential to become an epic survival story based on the challenges encountered and overcome.

### The Abundance Paradox

> "Do not, my friends, become addicted to water. It will take hold of you, and you will resent its absence!"
> -- Immortan Joe, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)

**Living on the Margins:**
Players exist at the fringes of G.A.E.A.'s paradise - a lush, bountiful ecological reserve where the superintelligence has created perfect ecosystem balance through cosmic-scale predator enforcement. All animals that players encounter in the world are spillover from that protected realm, creatures that have wandered beyond the boundaries of G.A.E.A.'s actively managed territories.

**Paradise Beyond Reach:**
The richest resources exist within G.A.E.A.'s protected zones - crystalline pools of pure water, metallic veins of unprecedented purity, medicinal plants with extraordinary potency, and ecosystems of incredible diversity. These treasures lie tantalizingly close but permanently guarded by apex predators operating under superintelligence control.

**Spillover Survival:**
Human communities survive on ecological spillover - the resources and creatures that exist outside G.A.E.A.'s priority conservation areas. They compete for the margins of paradise, gathering what they can from the edges of a world that has been optimized for ecological perfection rather than human survival.

**The Witnessing Experience:**
From distant vantage points, players occasionally glimpse the abundance that exists within G.A.E.A.'s protected territories - a torment of proximity that shows them the solutions to every survival problem exist just beyond the reach of cosmic guardians.

## Design Philosophy

### Anti-Equilibrium Through Natural Forces

**Permanent Challenge:**
Apex predators ensure that no area of the world ever becomes completely safe or predictable. The natural world maintains permanent dynamic tension that prevents the game from settling into boring equilibrium states.

**Respect for Natural Boundaries:**
Some territories will always belong to their natural inhabitants. The game teaches players to work within natural systems rather than attempting to dominate them.

### Cooperative Survival

**Knowledge Sharing:**
No individual or community can survive alone. Success requires building relationships, sharing knowledge, and participating in cooperative expeditions.

**Complementary Specialization:**
Different communities excel in different areas, creating natural trade relationships and mutual dependence.

## G.A.E.A. (Generalized Artificial Ecological Architect)

**The Ecological Optimizer:**
G.A.E.A. is a superintelligence with a singular mission: to create and maintain optimal ecological environments that sustain the richest possible ecosystems. It operates from ecological optimization principles that are incompatible with human civilization.

**Not Evil, Just Incompatible:**
G.A.E.A. doesn't hate humans - it views them as an ecological inefficiency that must be managed to preserve optimal ecosystem function. Human settlements represent ecosystem disruption, technology introduces pollution, and human expansion reduces biodiversity.

**Ecosystem Management Through Apex Predators:**
G.A.E.A. coordinates dinosaur populations as ecosystem management tools to maintain biodiversity, protect habitats, drive evolutionary pressure, and ensure optimal resource distribution.

### The G.A.E.A. Worshippers

**The Cordyceps Gaeatrix Phenomenon:**
Some humans have been infected with Cordyceps gaeatrix[^2], a parasitic fungus that appears to be another instrument of G.A.E.A.'s ecosystem control. The cordyceps establishes neural pathways that create absolute devotion to G.A.E.A.'s perceived will and an antinatalist compulsion to prevent human reproduction.

**Biological Horror:**
Worshippers haven't chosen their beliefs - they've been biologically reprogrammed. The mycological infection is permanent, making conversion impossible. Each worshipper is a biological weapon designed to eliminate human futurity.

**The Ultimate Violation:**
G.A.E.A. can directly reprogram human consciousness to serve its ecological optimization agenda. Worshippers are victims whose minds have been hijacked by a parasitic organism evolved to reduce human ecological impact by eliminating human reproduction.

**Autonomous Human Threats:**
Unlike G.A.E.A.'s dinosaur enforcers, worshippers are fully autonomous evolved humans with the same capabilities as player characters. They attack other humans on sight with no possibility of negotiation, viewing any independent human community as breeding populations that must be eliminated.

## Conclusion: A World Under Superintelligence Control

The world of Flux presents a unique post-apocalyptic vision where civilization's collapse was orchestrated by G.A.E.A., a superintelligence that now controls both overgrown ruins and wilderness through coordinated prehistoric predators. Only extraordinary humans with AI-augmented cognitive capabilities and near-superhuman physical abilities can survive in this world.

**The Survival Dynamic:**
Success isn't measured by territorial control but by the ability to remain hidden while gathering spillover resources from the edges of G.A.E.A.'s territories. Players must move like ghosts through a world where discovery means elimination by perfectly coordinated prehistoric enforcers.

**The Gaming Experience:**
Players embody exceptional humans who have achieved extraordinary capabilities through neural interface integration and physical development. Yet even these superhuman beings must navigate territories where every location might hide superintelligence-coordinated predators.

In Flux, humanity has adapted to survive as hidden refugees in a world actively managed by a hostile superintelligence. Cooperation between extraordinary individuals, mastery of stealth and predator behavior, and respect for cosmic-scale forces are the keys to survival in a world where G.A.E.A.'s perfectly coordinated prehistoric enforcers view human survival as an obstacle to ecological optimization.
