Could some of your concerns be assuaged by designing the shape/topography of the world as follows:

- Central "plateau" which is lush and abundant with highly desirable resources. Players in our simulation exist on the *margins* of this hub, as entering the hub means certain death.
- The plateau, as its name suggests, is elevated, above a circular mountain range which forms a band along the hub's perimeter. Marked by valleys and peaks.
- Outside this mountainous band, we have separate eco system, each connecting to the hub in an arrangement that looks like slices of pizza with a hole in the center, where someone has bitten it off. The bitten-off edge makes contact with the mountainous band.
