[The Crossing, Immortals' Approach]
This cobblestone walk is heavily trafficked with guests leaving the Half Pint Inn to the west and monks and pilgrims traveling to and from the temple to the southeast.  Next to this path looms one of the walls of the High Temple enclosing the fire topped towers and walkways soaring far above.  Although life bustles on around you, you pause to contemplate deeper issues for a brief moment.  Emerging from your reverie, you resume your journey.  You also see a hedged archway.
Obvious paths: north, southeast, west.
