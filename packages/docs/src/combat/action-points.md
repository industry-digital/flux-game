# Action Points (AP)

Action Points represent your character's time budget during each combat round. Every combatant receives exactly `6.0` AP per turn, which corresponds to 6 seconds of time in the game world.

$$1 \text{ AP} = 1 \text{ second}$$

## Rules

- Every character gets exactly `6.0` AP at the start of their turn.
- Unused AP does not carry over into the next turn.
- AP costs are calculated to the nearest `0.1` AP (one-tenth of a second).

### Action Costs
Different actions consume different amounts of your time budget:

- **Movement**: Variable cost based on distance and your shell configuration
- **Strike**: Variable cost based on weapon and your shell configuration
- **Defend**: Consumes all remaining AP for maximum defensive benefit
