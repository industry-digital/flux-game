# Character Concept

## Traditional Character Design

Most role-playing games structure character progression around a unified stat system. Your character possesses strength, dexterity, intelligence, and other attributes that increase through experience or equipment upgrades. When your character gains power, all capabilities improve together as a single entity.

Consider a typical fantasy character with these attributes:

**Thorin the Warrior**
- Strength:     18 (physical power)
- Dexterity:    12 (agility and speed)
- Constitution: 16 (endurance and health)
- Intelligence: 10 (reasoning ability)
- Wisdom:       13 (awareness and judgment)
- Charisma:      8 (social influence)

When Thorin gains experience, all these capabilities can potentially improve as part of the same character advancement system.

## The Core/Shell Distinction

Flux separates your character into two distinct parts: **Core** and **Shell**. This fundamental split changes how character progression, death, and tactical planning function throughout the game.

### Your Core: Persistent Consciousness

The **Core** represents your consciousness. It is the thinking, learning, decision-making entity that persists across all physical forms. Your Core has these attributes:

**Perception (PER)**: Environmental awareness and information processing capability. Superior Perception improves combat initiative and increases the rate at which you gain potential experience (PXP).

**Intelligence (INT)**: Decision-making speed and learning efficiency. Higher Intelligence reduces the time cost of tactical assessment and accelerates skill acquisition during expeditions. Also directly increases the rate at which you convert PXP to actual learned experience (XP).

**Memory (MEM)**: Knowledge retention and skill capacity. Enhanced Memory allows you to "memorize" more specialized abilities, and expands your potential experience (PXP) pool.

**Skills and Abilities**: All learned techniques, combat maneuvers, and specialized knowledge. These capabilities never disappear regardless of physical circumstances.

**Relationships and Reputation**: Bonds with expedition partners and standing within survivor communities. Social connections persist independently of physical form.

### Your Shell: Disposable Physical Form

The **Shell** represents your artificial body. It is a sophisticated marvel of technology that provides physical capabilities but can be optimized, destroyed, and replaced. Your Shell determines:

**Power (POW)**: Directly determines damage output and maximum movement speed.

**Finesse (FIN)**: Directly determines acceleration and evasion.

**Resilience (RES)**: Directly determines stamina and resistance to injury.

**Component Configuration**: Specialized equipment and enhancement modules that modify Shell performance for specific tactical roles.

## Death and Reconstruction

Shell destruction creates meaningful consequences without character elimination. When your Shell suffers catastrophic damage, your Core consciousness immediately transfers to backup systems while the destroyed Shell and its component investment are permanently lost.

**What You Lose**: Physical capabilities return to baseline levels. Specialized components and rare materials invested in the destroyed Shell cannot be recovered.

**What Persists**: Core consciousness remains unchanged with all skills, abilities, and accumulated knowledge intact. Relationships with expedition partners and community standing continue unaffected. Understanding of Shell optimization and tactical approaches carries forward to inform future builds.

## The Mastery Principle

Experienced Cores achieve extraordinary results with basic Shell configurations through two complementary advantages: **unlocked Abilities** that provide genuine mechanical power, and **accumulated expertise** in applying those capabilities effectively.

### Ability Progression

As Core skills advance, they unlock powerful Abilities that fundamentally expand tactical options. A veteran Core operating a basic Shell possesses capabilities that novice Cores cannot access regardless of their Shell quality.

## Progression Philosophy

Character advancement focuses on consciousness evolution rather than equipment accumulation. Your Core develops permanent capabilities that transcend any individual Shell configuration, while your understanding of Shell optimization deepens through repeated construction and deployment cycles.

Each Shell destruction becomes an opportunity to rebuild more effectively, experiment with new approaches, and apply accumulated knowledge to create superior configurations. The most dangerous operators are often those with extensive reconstruction experience who have learned to maximize performance within resource constraints.

This system rewards tactical understanding and adaptive thinking over time investment or equipment hoarding. Your identity centers on decision-making expertise and technical mastery rather than the temporary physical capabilities of any particular Shell configuration.
