# Combat Encounters

Combat starts when you attack someone from another party. The fight continues until one side is eliminated or retreats.

## Party Involvement

When you attack someone, their entire party automatically joins the fight against your entire party. Even 1v1 duels follow this rule; they're just fights between two parties that each contain one person.

## Late Joiners

Party members who arrive at the combat location after fighting has started automatically join their party's side. Late arrivals roll initiative but cannot act or be attacked until the next round begins. When the new round starts, they enter the turn order based on their initiative rolls.

Combat is always between exactly two parties. Third parties cannot join ongoing combat.

*For details on where late joiners are positioned on the battlefield, see [Movement System](./movement#combat-entry-positioning).*

## Victory Conditions

Combat ends when one party is eliminated through death, retreat, or withdrawal. Mutual destruction occurs if all participants are defeated simultaneously.

## Turn Timers

Taking too long on your turn triggers an automatic `DEFEND` command that ends your turn. Repeated delays make future timers activate faster.
