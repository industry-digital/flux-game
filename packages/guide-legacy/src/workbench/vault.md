# Vault Operations

## Core Concepts

The **Vault** represents your consciousness's persistent storage facility - a secure inventory space that survives shell destruction and provides the foundation for tactical loadout management across your shell arsenal.

**Vault inventory** contains resources, materials, and equipment that belong to your consciousness rather than any specific shell. These items remain accessible regardless of which shell you currently inhabit or lose during missions.

**Shell inventory** contains the tactical loadout deployed with each specific shell. These items are at risk during missions but provide immediate operational capability for specialized roles.

## Vault vs Shell Storage

**Vault Storage** maintains permanent access to:
- Raw materials and crafting components
- Rare salvaged items and exotic technology
- Consumables and medical supplies
- Blueprints and technical documentation
- Currency and faction tokens

**Shell Storage** provides tactical deployment of:
- Weapons and combat equipment
- Mission-specific tools and sensors
- Mounted components and shell modifications
- Ammunition and expendable resources
- Specialized gear for current operations

## Transfer Operations

Item transfer between vault and shell inventories occurs through workbench interfaces that enable strategic loadout configuration before missions.

```text
> transfer <item> to shell
> transfer <item> to vault
> transfer <quantity> <item> to shell
```

**Vault to Shell** transfers deploy resources from secure storage to your currently active shell inventory for immediate use. These items become at-risk during missions but provide operational capability.

**Shell to Vault** transfers secure valuable items from your current shell to consciousness storage, removing them from mission risk while maintaining long-term access.

## Arsenal Management

The vault system enables loadout management across your three-shell arsenal by requiring shell switching to configure each shell's inventory individually.

**Shell Specialization** benefits from vault resources distributed strategically across different tactical roles. Reconnaissance shells receive sensors and stealth equipment while combat shells receive weapons and armor.

**Risk Distribution** allows consciousness to manage exposure by keeping valuable items in vault storage until specific missions require their deployment to shell inventories.

## Strategic Implications

**Pre-Mission Planning** requires decisions about which vault resources to deploy with each shell based on mission parameters and acceptable risk levels.

**Shell Loss Recovery** preserves vault resources when shells are destroyed, enabling rapid reconstruction of new shells using stored materials and components.

**Resource Optimization** maximizes tactical capability by distributing limited rare items across shell arsenal based on mission requirements rather than permanent assignment.

## Vault Security

Vault inventory provides absolute security for consciousness resources. Items stored in vault cannot be lost through shell destruction, mission failure, or combat encounters.

**Persistent Access** ensures vault resources remain available across all shell configurations and survive consciousness transfer events during shell destruction.

**Strategic Reserve** maintains essential resources for shell reconstruction and tactical adaptation when primary shells are lost or damaged during operations.
