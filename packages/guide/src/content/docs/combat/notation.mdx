description: Visual language for representing battlefield states, combatant positions, and tactical situations.

import { BattlefieldNotation } from '@flux/ui';

Battlefield notation is the visual language used throughout the combat system to represent battlefield states, combatant positions, and tactical situations. This standardized ASCII representation provides precise, at-a-glance understanding of who is where, how far apart they are, and which direction they're facing.

<BattlefieldNotation
  client:load
  currentActor="alice"
  subjectTeam="alpha"
  combatants={[
    { name: 'Alice', position: 100, facing: 'right', team: 'alpha', id: 'alice' },
    { name: 'Bob', position: 150, facing: 'left', team: 'bravo', id: 'bob' }
  ]}
/>

Breaking this down:
- `[ ]` - Position brackets containing all combatants at that coordinate
- `A₁>` - Actor glyph with facing direction
- `─50m─` - Distance between positions
- **Bold** indicates the current actor

## Actor Glyphs

Actor glyphs use the first letter of the combatant's name with numeric subscripts. When multiple actors share the same first letter, sequential subscripts are assigned. All actors receive subscripts for consistency, even when unique.

**Legend:**
- **A₁**: Alice
- **A₂**: Arthur
- **A₃**: Anna

## Facing Indicators

Facing indicators show combatant orientation using chevrons:

- **Right-facing**: `A₁>` (glyph followed by chevron)
- **Left-facing**: `<A₁` (chevron followed by glyph)

When combatants at the same position face opposite directions, whitespace separates the groups.

## Boundary Markers

When combatants approach battlefield boundaries, a boundary marker `▌` indicates the edge:

{/*
<BattlefieldNotation
  subjectTeam="alpha"
  combatants={[
    { name: 'Alice', position: 100, facing: 'right', team: 'alpha' },
    { name: 'Bob', position: 150, facing: 'left', team: 'bravo' }
  ]}
  boundaries={[
    { position: 160, side: 'right' }
  ]}
/>
*/}

```
[ A₁> ]─50m─[ <B₁ ]▌
```

## Complex Example

{/*
<BattlefieldNotation
  currentActor="Charlie"
  subjectTeam="alpha"
  combatants={[
    { name: 'Alice', position: 50, facing: 'right', team: 'alpha' },
    { name: 'Bob', position: 50, facing: 'left', team: 'alpha' },
    { name: 'Charlie', position: 125, facing: 'right', team: 'alpha' },
    { name: 'David', position: 175, facing: 'left', team: 'bravo' },
    { name: 'Eve', position: 175, facing: 'right', team: 'bravo' }
  ]}
/>
*/}

```
[ <B₁ A₁> ]─75m─[ **C₁>** ]─50m─[ <D₁ E₁> ]
```

**Legend:**
- **A₁**: Alice
- **B₁**: Bob
- **C₁**: Charlie (current actor)
- **D₁**: David
- **E₁**: Eve

This example demonstrates:
- Multiple teammates at the same position (Alice & Bob, David & Eve)
- Facing separation (whitespace between opposite-facing teammates)
- Current actor highlighting (Charlie in bold)
- Team color coding (green for player's team, red for opposing teams)
- Distance gaps between position groups

:::tip[Team Colors]
**Green** = your team

**Red** = opposing teams

## Edge Case: Boundary Position

What happens when a combatant is positioned directly at a battlefield boundary?

{/*
<BattlefieldNotation
  currentActor="Alice"
  subjectTeam="alpha"
  combatants={[
    { name: 'Alice', position: 0, facing: 'right', team: 'alpha' },
    { name: 'Bob', position: 100, facing: 'left', team: 'bravo' }
  ]}
  boundaries={[
    { position: 0, side: 'left' }
  ]}
/>
*/}

```
▌[ **A₁>** ]─100m─[ <B₁ ]
```

**Legend:**
- **A₁**: Alice (at left boundary)
- **B₁**: Bob

In this scenario, Alice is positioned exactly at coordinate 0, which is the left edge of the battlefield. The boundary marker appears directly adjacent to her position bracket with no distance indicator.
