# Combat Overview

The combat system is a turn-based tactical combat engine featuring physics-based movement and resource management. Combat takes place on a 300-meter linear battlefield where positioning, timing, and resource management determine victory.

The system synthesizes ideas from Street Fighter's linear battlefield mechanics, Divinity Original Sin 2's tactical positioning, and EVE Online's physics-based movement.

## Linear Battlefield

Combat occurs on a 300-meter linear battlefield using precise coordinate positioning. Combatants occupy specific coordinate points from `0` to `300`, with distances measured as one-meter segments between positions.

When combat begins, opposing forces start 100 meters apart at the battlefield center:

```
0       50      100      150      200      250      300
├────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┤
                [ A₁> ]───100────[ <B₁ ]
```

**Legend:**
- **A₁**: Alice at position 100, facing right
- **B₁**: Bob at position 200, facing left

Each combatant faces either left (`<`) or right (`>`) on the battlefield. Movement costs derive from physics calculations based on character statistics and the discrete segments traversed.

For detailed movement mechanics, physics integration, and tactical examples, see [Movement System](./movement/).

## Battlefield Notation

The system uses a standarized notation to represent battlefield states:

<BattlefieldNotation
  currentActor="Alice"
  subjectTeam="alpha"
  combatants={[
    { name: 'Alice', position: 100, facing: 'right', team: 'alpha' },
    { name: 'Bob', position: 150, facing: 'left', team: 'bravo' }
  ]}
/>

This notation shows combatant positions (`[ ]`), actor symbols (`A₁`, `B₁`), facing directions (`>`, `<`), and distances between positions (`─50m─`).

For complete notation rules, visual formatting, and complex battlefield examples, see [Battlefield Notation](./notation/).

## Collision Rules

- Combatants may not move outside the battlefield boundaries.
- Allies may occupy the same coordinate and pass through each other freely.
- Enemies maintain a minimum 1-meter separation and cannot pass through each other without the use of [abilities](../skills/#abilities).

## Action Point System

Action Points represent your character's "time budget" during each combat round, where each `AP` equals one second of time.

$$1 \text{ AP} = 1 \text{ second}$$

On each turn, a combatant receives exactly `6.0 AP` per turn, calculated to the nearest `0.1 AP` precision. The combatant spends this time budget to perform a variety of [combat actions](./actions/).

For detailed AP mechanics, action costs, and physics integration, see [Action Points](./action-points/).

## Initiative and Turn Order

Turn order is determined by rolling **1d20 + Perception modifier** for each combatant at combat start:

$$I_{roll} = 1d20 + PER_{modifier}$$

Higher results act first, with ties broken by Finesse stat, combat initiator advantage, and deterministic sorting. Each turn grants a full `6.0 AP` pool and follows a structured sequence from action execution to victory condition evaluation.

For complete initiative mechanics, tie-breaking rules, and turn timer systems, see [Combat Encounters](./session/).

## Combat Actions

The system provides both high-level AI assistance and precise tactical control through a two-tier interface.

**Core Actions**: `TARGET` designates opponents; `ADVANCE` and `RETREAT` handle positioning with distance or AP specification; `STRIKE` executes weapon attacks; `DEFEND` maximizes defensive benefits; `DONE` ends turns voluntarily.

**Movement Specification**: Actions accept either distance (`advance distance 20m`) for precise positioning or `AP` (`advance ap 2.5`) for resource budgeting.

For complete action syntax, examples, and tactical applications, see [Combat Actions](./actions/).

## Two-Tier Accessibility

The system accommodates both newcomers and experts through dual interfaces:

**High-Level AI** (`ATTACK`): New players can fight effectively using AI-driven optimization that automatically generates optimal action sequences, considering weapon range, positioning, and resource management.

**Low-Level Primitives** (`STRIKE`, `ADVANCE`, `RETREAT`): Experienced players gain precise control for executing specific tactical maneuvers and advanced strategies.

The `ATTACK` command enables immediate tactical effectiveness while individual actions provide granular control when needed.
