The Workbench is a diagetic interface through which you can make modifications
to your shell.

```text
# Establish neural connection with the Workbench
# Only works while the player's consciousness is "co-located" with the workbench object in the game world
> use workbench

# Arsenal management - consciousness surveys available shells
> shell list                                  # Display all shells in the three-shell arsenal

> shell swap <id>                             # Transfer consciousness to different shell

> shell status                                # Comprehensive analysis of active shell
> shell reorder <from> <to>                   # Change shell list order

# Stat optimization
> shell attributes                              # Display current shell attributes (POW, FIN, RES)
> shell attributes add POW|FIN|RES <increment>  # Stages a change

# Component integration - physical shell modification
> shell component list                        # Inventory mounted systems
> shell component examine <component_name>    # Detailed component analysis
> shell component mount <component_name>      # Install new hardware
> shell component unmount <component_name>    # Remove existing systems

> shell commit                                # Commit all staged changes
> shell undo                                  # Revert staged changes

> inventory components                        # List available components
> inventory materials                         # Show raw materials and resources

# Exit the Workbench
> exit|quit|bye
