# Your Character

## The Core + Shell System

Your character exists as **consciousness operating through artificial form**.

**The Shell** represents your artificial body - a sophisticated technological platform that provides physical capabilities but can be upgraded, repaired, destroyed, and replaced. Shell destruction is a strategic setback, not character death. Your consciousness immediately transfers to safety while a baseline replacement shell materializes at the point of loss.

**The Core** represents your consciousness. Memories, learned skills, accumulated knowledge, and essential identity. These attributes survive shell destruction and grow permanently through experience.

## Core Stats

Core stats define the permanent capabilities of your consciousness and determine how effectively you learn, perceive, and retain information across all shell configurations.

**Intelligence (INT)** accelerates the conversion of potential experience (PXP) into realized experience (XP).

**Perception (PER)** increases the rate at which you gain potential experience (PXP) through environmental interaction.

**Memory (MEM)** expands your PXP pool and allows you to "memorize" more abilities in your head.

## Shell Stats

Shell stats define your artificial body's physical capabilities.

**Power (POW)** increases damage output and top speed.

**Finesse (FIN)** increases acceleration and evasion.

**Resilience (RES)** increases stamina, health, and resistance to injury.

## Character Progression

Shell stats are optimized at the workbench. You allocate resources (scrap) to improve your shell's stats. The cost of such upgrades increases exponentially with the stat value.

Core stats are increased through skill development. Every three ranks in your *top three skills* grants a permanent core stat increase.

## Statistical Interactions

Core and Shell statistics interact to determine overall capability in complex scenarios that require both mental acuity and physical performance.

**Combat Effectiveness** combines Shell statistics for physical performance with Core statistics for tactical awareness and decision speed. High Intelligence reduces the time required to assess threats and select optimal responses, while Shell statistics determine execution capability.

**Learning Efficiency** uses Core statistics to determine how quickly you develop new skills and abilities. Higher Intelligence converts potential experience faster, while higher Memory allows accumulation of more learning opportunities before conversion becomes necessary.

**Environmental Adaptation** requires both consciousness capabilities for situation assessment and shell capabilities for physical response. Perception enables threat detection and opportunity recognition, while Shell statistics determine your ability to act on that information effectively.

## Resource Management

The separation between Core and Shell statistics creates strategic resource allocation decisions that define character development approaches.

**Core Investment** focuses on permanent consciousness enhancement through skill development and experience accumulation. This approach emphasizes long-term capability growth that transcends individual shell configurations.

**Shell Investment** focuses on optimizing artificial bodies through material allocation and component integration. This approach emphasizes immediate tactical capability that can be lost through shell destruction but provides significant short-term advantages.

**Balanced Development** maintains progression in both areas, accepting slower advancement in exchange for comprehensive capability across all scenarios. This approach provides tactical flexibility while ensuring steady permanent growth.
