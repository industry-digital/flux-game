# Effects

## What Are Effects?

**Effects** are temporary conditions applied to your character - injuries, buffs, debuffs, poisons, etc.

## How Effects Work

- **Start weak or strong** depending on the effect type
- **Change over time** - some fade, others build up
- **End automatically** when their time runs out
- **Can be removed early** by certain actions (healing, dispelling, death)

## Common Effect Types

**Injuries:** Bleeding, broken bones, burns - usually start bad and heal over time

**Buffs:** Strength boosts, speed increases - often build up then fade

**Debuffs:** Poison, fatigue, curses - vary in how they progress

**Status:** Stunned, invisible, paralyzed - usually on/off states

## Checking Your Effects

Use `status` to see all active effects on your character.

## Key Things to Know

- Multiple effects can stack (you can have bleeding AND poison)
- Some effects end if you move, take damage, or die
- Effect strength changes over time - fresh wounds bleed more than old ones
