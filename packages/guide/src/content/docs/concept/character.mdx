description: Understanding the Core/Shell distinction that defines character progression in FSP.
---

Most role-playing games structure character progression around a unified stat system. Your character possesses various raw capabilities, like strength and intelligence, that increase with experience or character level. When your character gains power, these attributes improve together.

Consider a typical fantasy character with these attributes:

**Thorin the Warrior**
- Strength:     18 (physical power)
- Dexterity:    12 (agility and speed)
- Constitution: 16 (endurance and health)
- Intelligence: 10 (reasoning ability)
- Wisdom:       13 (awareness and judgment)
- Charisma:      8 (social influence)

When Thorin gains experience, all these capabilities can potentially improve as part of the same character advancement system.

## Core vs. Shell

FSP splits your character into two distinct parts: the **Core** and the **Shell**.

### Core: Persistent Consciousness

The **Core** represents your consciousness. It is the thinking, learning, decision-making entity that persists across all physical forms. Your Core has these attributes:

**Intelligence (INT)**: Decision-making speed and learning efficiency.
**Perception (PER)**: Environmental awareness and information processing capability.
**Memory (MEM)**: Knowledge retention and skill capacity.

**Skills and Abilities**: All learned techniques, combat maneuvers, specialized knowledge, and relationships, belong to the Core.

### Shell: Temporary Physical Form

The **Shell** is your artificial body. An advanced piece of tech that handles all the physical stuff. You can upgrade it, lose it in combat, and build a new one.

The Shell has these attributes:

**Power (POW)**: Damage, top speed, power output
**Finesse (FIN)**: Acceleration, evasion, inertial mass reduction
**Resilience (RES)**: Stamina and resistance to injury

**Component Configuration**: Specialized equipment and enhancement modules that modify Shell performance for specific tactical roles. Examples include:

- Weapons
- Armor
- Sensors and instruments
- Specialization kits for covert ops, CQC, mobility, etc.

You can upgrade your Shell using materials and components you find in the world. All three stats - POW, FIN, and RES - work this way.

## Death and Reconstruction

When your Shell gets destroyed, your consciousness immediately transfers to a new body. Your Core survives; the physical Shell doesn't.

**What You Lose**: Physical capabilities return to baseline levels. You lose specialized components and rare materials invested in the destroyed shell, as well as what it was carrying.

**What Stays With You**: Your Core consciousness keeps all skills, abilities, and knowledge. You also retain everything you've learned about Shell optimization and tactics - knowledge that helps you build better Shells next time.

## Instrumentalist Mastery

Character progression follows an *instrumentalist* philosophy: your body serves your mind, not the other way around. Shells are tools - powerful ones, but still just tools. Veteran players prove this by dominating with basic Shells through two key advantages: unlocked [Abilities](./abilities) that give them more tactical options, and hard-earned expertise in using those abilities when it counts.

## Different Body for Different Situations

The Core/Shell split means you can inhabit any body that fits the job. Need to punch through heavy defenses? Build a high-POW Shell. Running reconnaissance? Go with high-FIN for speed and evasion. Not sure what you'll face? A balanced Shell keeps your options open.

This changes how you plan expeditions. Instead of asking "what can my character do?" you ask "what Shell do I need for this mission?" Different Shell types excel in different situations, so smart players maintain several specialized builds and pick the right one before heading out.

Experienced players approach each expedition strategically. Stealth mission? Grab the reconnaissance Shell. Expecting heavy combat? Load up the assault Shell. Extraction run? High-mobility Shell it is. The key decision happens during briefing, not in combat - you match your Shell to what you expect to face.
