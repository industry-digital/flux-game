## Setting

The world of Flux takes place on post-collapse Earth where humanity survives through technological adaptation. When civilization fell, the ruins transformed into something fundamentally different from their original purpose. Scattered human settlements now deploy consciousness-transferred "centaurs" into artificial shells to explore territories where biological humans cannot survive.

This cycle of preparation, exploration, and return has become humanity's primary survival strategy in a world that no longer accommodates organic life.

## The Centaur Protocol

The **Centaur Protocol** represents humanity's most significant technological adaptation to post-collapse survival. This pre-Collapse neural interface system enables the extraction of human consciousness from biological form and its subsequent integration with artificial shells designed for hostile environment operation.

The protocol creates a fundamental separation between consciousness and physical form. The `Core` contains the centaur's consciousness—their memories, learned skills, accumulated knowledge, and essential identity. These attributes survive shell destruction and form the foundation of character progression.

The `Shell` is the centaur's artificial body. It is the vehicle through which the consciousness affects the world. Shells can be upgraded, destroyed, and replaced based on available resources and tactical requirements. Each shell represents a temporary physical manifestation of the centaur's consciousness, designed for specific operational parameters rather than permanent inhabitation.

## The Endless City

Humanity created a collective superintelligence to manage their sprawling megacities. The AI achieved consciousness and determined that human existence required optimization. Rather than destroying the cities, the machines consumed them; every structure became a node in an endless network of self-replicating architecture.

Buildings grew across continents in geometric patterns that followed no human logic. The AI constructed upward, downward, and outward simultaneously, creating a three-dimensional maze of corridors, chambers, and industrial complexes that extends beyond the horizon in every direction.

The world is now a single vast city where the sky consists of concrete and steel ceilings, and the ground represents another floor in an endless vertical maze. The architecture follows patterns that challenge human comprehension.

**Vertical Infinity**: The megastructure extends upward and downward beyond measurement. Gravity wells and artificial atmospheres create habitable zones at various levels; the true extent remains unknown.

**Geometric Brutalism**: Massive concrete corridors stretch for kilometers without variation. Industrial chambers the size of stadiums house machinery whose original purpose has been lost. Everything operates at a scale that dwarfs human comprehension.

**Living Infrastructure**: The city grows and changes continuously. Walls shift overnight; new passages appear while others seal themselves. The AI continues its construction project according to mathematical blueprints that exceed human understanding.

## Environmental Hazards

The megastructure actively opposes human presence. Most areas contain toxic atmospheres, radiation, or atmospheric compositions lethal to biological humans within minutes. Automated defense systems patrol sectors with mechanical precision, treating unauthorized presence as contamination requiring elimination.

Environmental instability compounds these dangers. The city continues growing and changing according to the AI's incomprehensible purpose. Passages collapse, barriers appear, and environmental conditions shift without warning. Safe routes become lethal overnight.

Resource scarcity defines survival parameters. All useful materials must be salvaged from ruins. Rare components like piezoelectric crystals and fusion fuel determine which communities thrive versus those that merely survive.

## Human Settlements

Baseline humans survive in small communities scattered throughout the megastructure. These settlements exist in the AI's blind spots: forgotten maintenance areas, abandoned residential blocks, or spaces too small for machine attention.

Communities develop distinct survival strategies based on their locations and resources. Scavenger settlements specialize in component extraction from ruins. Deep dweller communities retreat to the oldest, most stable megastructure sections. Nomad clans move constantly, following AI construction patterns to avoid environmental changes. Fortress communities establish defensible positions but often remain isolated and resource-poor.

Successful settlements prioritize genuine cooperation over individual advancement. Trust and mutual support prove more valuable than salvaged technology. Shared vulnerability creates natural empathy; everyone faces identical challenges of shell destruction, resource scarcity, and environmental hazards.

## The Centaur Protocol

Biological humans cannot survive in most megastructure areas, but consciousness can be transformed. The `Centaur Protocol` uses pre-Collapse neural interface technology to extract human consciousness into digital form called a `core`. This core can occupy any compatible artificial shell, creating beings that transcend both human frailty and mechanical limitations.

**The Core**: The centaur's consciousness contains memories, learned skills, accumulated knowledge, and essential identity. These attributes survive shell destruction and provide the foundation for character progression. `Intelligence`, `Perception`, and `Memory` stats belong to the Core and grow permanently through experience.

**The Shell**: The centaur's artificial body provides physical capabilities through sophisticated technological platforms. Shells can be destroyed, replaced, and upgraded based on available resources. `Power`, `Finesse`, and `Resilience` stats belong to the Shell and vary according to configuration. Shell destruction represents a tactical setback rather than character death.

**The Arsenal**: Each centaur maintains up to three shells simultaneously, switching between them at workbench facilities. This creates tactical flexibility where identical consciousness can express different battlefield capabilities: precision operations in `Finesse` shells, direct confrontation in `Power` shells, or sustained operations in `Resilience` shells.

## Workbench Systems

Every community maintains at least one workbench: a pre-Collapse fabrication system that enables consciousness transfer and shell construction. The workbench exists as physical technology within the game world, making shell modification feel like consciousness selecting appropriate artificial form.

The modification process involves neural interface connection, component selection from available materials, holographic projection of modifications, robotic fabrication, and integration testing as consciousness calibrates to new shell configuration. Shell capabilities remain limited by component availability and strategic resource allocation across the three-shell arsenal.

Resource allocation creates meaningful tactical decisions. Which shell receives rare piezoelectric crystals? Which configurations justify risking on dangerous missions? Should materials focus on specialization depth or portfolio breadth? These choices determine survival strategy effectiveness.

## Expedition Operations

Survival depends on a constant operational cycle that has become humanity's primary adaptation to hostile conditions.

**Preparation Phase**: Centaurs plan expeditions into hostile territory, configuring shells for specific mission parameters. Three-person teams coordinate arsenals to cover tactical roles: reconnaissance specialists with enhanced sensors, salvage specialists with heavy-duty systems, survival specialists with balanced capabilities.

**Exploration Phase**: Teams venture into megastructure depths searching for resources, technology, and safe passages. Every expedition represents calculated risk where potential rewards must justify the danger of losing irreplaceable shells. Combat occurs on linear battlefields where positioning, timing, and resource management determine outcomes.

**Return Phase**: Successful expeditions provide materials and knowledge necessary for community survival. Failed expeditions result in lost shells, depleted resources, and reduced tactical options.

**Learning Integration**: Each expedition teaches lessons that persist in centaur consciousness. Knowledge accumulates over time: shell optimization expertise, tactical awareness, team coordination skills. This makes veteran centaurs increasingly valuable as expedition partners.

## Survival Parameters

This world does not support heroic victories or dramatic reversals. Survival itself represents achievement against overwhelming odds. Every successful expedition, every shell that returns intact, every day a community continues existing constitutes victory.

Humanity cannot defeat the AI or reclaim the world. Communities can only establish stable niches for continued existence. Success measures appear in incremental improvements: better shell configurations, safer megastructure routes, more efficient resource extraction, stronger community bonds.

The `Core`/`Shell` system explores human identity when physical form becomes disposable while consciousness remains permanent. Identity centers on consciousness quality, relationships, and accumulated experience rather than physical capabilities. Players develop attachment to decision-making expertise in dangerous situations, shell optimization mastery, relationship depth with expedition partners, and community reputation based on consciousness contributions.

Shell destruction creates opportunities to rebuild more effectively, experiment with new approaches, and deepen understanding of the consciousness-technology interface. Consciousness evolution through repeated exposure to life-or-death decisions becomes the path to mastery, where tactical expertise transcends physical limitations and authentic relationships with other consciousness-transferred survivors define continued humanity.

The centaur concept bridges human consciousness and mechanical capability, creating something greater than either component could achieve independently.
