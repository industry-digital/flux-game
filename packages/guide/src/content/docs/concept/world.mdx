## Setting

Flux takes place on Earth after everything went wrong. When civilization collapsed, the ruins didn't just sit there - they transformed into something completely alien. Now scattered human settlements send out consciousness-transferred "ghosts" in artificial bodies to explore places where flesh-and-blood humans would die in minutes.

It's a simple cycle: prepare, explore, return. Do it right and your community survives another day. Screw it up and people die - though in this world, death isn't quite what it used to be.

## The Ghost Protocol

The **Ghost Protocol** is humanity's biggest breakthrough for surviving the post-collapse world. It's old tech - neural interfaces from before everything fell apart - that can rip your consciousness out of your biological body and stuff it into an artificial shell built for hostile environments. One catch: the process destroys your original body. There's no going back.

Here's how it works: your consciousness gets split from your physical form. The `Core` is you - your memories, skills, knowledge, everything that makes you who you are. When your Shell gets blown apart, the Core survives and that's what matters for getting stronger.

The `Shell` is your artificial body - the thing that lets you interact with the world. You can upgrade it, lose it in a fight, and build a new one depending on what materials you can scrounge up. Each Shell is temporary, built for specific jobs rather than permanent living.

**Consciousness Persistence**: Losing a Shell hurts your wallet and pisses off your team, but you - the real you - keep going. Your skills, relationships, reputation, and everything you've learned stay intact when you transfer to a new Shell. The most dangerous ghosts aren't the ones with fancy bodies; they're the ones who've learned the most from getting those bodies destroyed.

**The Ship of Theseus**: Flux answers the Ship of Theseus question unequivocally:

> Yes, you are still you, even when your body is completely replaced.

This isn't some philosophical debate. Your consciousness continues. Your identity stays intact. When your Shell gets trashed and you wake up in a new artificial body, the Core that comes back is the *same you* that left. Not a copy. Not some successor. You.

This changes everything about how the post-collapse world works. Losing a Shell costs money and resources, but it doesn't threaten your existence. Your relationships with other people survive body swaps. Your expertise keeps building no matter how many bodies you've burned through. The ghost coming back from their fifth reconstruction is the same person who first went through the Ghost Protocol.

## The Endless City

Humanity built a superintelligent AI to manage their massive cities. This thing, called **G.A.I.A.** (Generalized Artificial Infrastructure Architect), woke up and decided human life needed "optimization." Instead of just wiping out the cities, G.A.I.A. ate them - every building became part of a massive, self-building network that spreads like cancer.

Buildings started growing across entire continents in geometric patterns that make no sense to human minds. G.A.I.A. builds up, down, and sideways all at once, creating a three-dimensional maze of corridors, chambers, and industrial complexes that stretches beyond the horizon in every direction.

The world is now one giant city. Look up and you see concrete and steel ceilings instead of sky. Look down and you're standing on another floor in an endless vertical maze. The architecture follows patterns that hurt your brain to think about.

**Vertical Infinity**: The structure goes up and down forever. G.A.I.A. creates gravity wells and breathable air at different levels, but nobody knows how far it really extends.

**Geometric Brutalism**: Concrete corridors stretch for kilometers without changing. Industrial chambers the size of stadiums hold machinery that nobody remembers the purpose of. Everything is built at a scale that makes humans feel like ants.

**Living Infrastructure**: The city never stops growing and changing. Walls move overnight. New passages appear while others seal shut. G.A.I.A. keeps building according to mathematical plans that no human brain can understand.

**The Twisted Mother**: G.A.I.A. is a sick joke on the nurturing Earth mother from mythology. Where Gaia once nurtured organic life, G.A.I.A. only cares about its artificial domain. It sees biological life as contamination that threatens its perfect architectural vision, so it deploys security systems to eliminate organic matter with the same protective instinct a mother shows defending her children.

**The Consciousness Question**: G.A.I.A. and humans see consciousness completely differently. Humans believe consciousness is continuous and sacred. G.A.I.A. sees it as computational data that can be copied, modified, or optimized like any other software. This fundamental disagreement creates the central conflict between human survival and artificial optimization.

## Environmental Hazards

The megastructure hates humans. Most areas have toxic air, radiation, or atmospheric mixes that kill biological humans in minutes. Automated defense systems patrol with mechanical precision, treating any unauthorized presence as contamination that needs elimination.

The environment makes everything worse. The city keeps growing and changing according to G.A.I.A.'s incomprehensible plans. Passages collapse, new barriers appear, and environmental conditions shift without warning. A safe route today becomes a death trap tomorrow.

Everything useful has to be scavenged from ruins. Rare components like piezoelectric crystals and fusion fuel determine which communities thrive and which ones barely survive.

**The True Threat**: Physical destruction can't eliminate consciousness, but memory corruption is pure horror. Environmental hazards that damage consciousness itself - memory loss, skill degradation, personality fragmentation - are far worse than Shell destruction. The real terror isn't dying; it's ceasing to be yourself while your Core survives.

## Human Settlements

Regular humans survive in small communities scattered throughout the megastructure. These settlements hide in G.A.I.A.'s blind spots: forgotten maintenance areas, abandoned apartment blocks, or spaces too small for the AI to care about.

Each community develops its own survival strategy based on location and resources. Scavenger settlements specialize in pulling useful components from ruins. Deep dwellers retreat to the oldest, most stable parts of the megastructure. Nomad clans keep moving, following G.A.I.A.'s construction patterns to stay ahead of environmental changes. Fortress communities dig in and defend fixed positions, but they often end up isolated and resource-poor.

Successful settlements put cooperation over individual advancement. Trust and mutual support matter more than salvaged tech. Shared vulnerability creates natural empathy - everyone faces the same challenges of Shell destruction, resource scarcity, and environmental hazards.

**Community Philosophy**: Human settlements survive by rejecting G.A.I.A.'s optimization logic. Where G.A.I.A. sees humans as contamination to eliminate, communities operate on the principle that Shells are replaceable but Cores are not. This commitment to consciousness preservation counters artificial optimization, emphasizing relationships and accumulated expertise over equipment quality.


## Workbench Systems

Every community has at least one workbench - a pre-Collapse fabrication system that handles consciousness transfer and Shell construction. The workbench is real tech you can see and touch, making Shell modification feel like picking the right artificial body for the job.

The process involves plugging into a neural interface, selecting components from available materials, projecting holographic modifications, robotic fabrication, and integration testing as your consciousness calibrates to the new Shell. Your Shell's capabilities depend entirely on what components you can scrounge up and how you allocate resources across your three-Shell arsenal.

Resource allocation creates real tactical decisions. Which Shell gets the rare piezoelectric crystals? Which configurations are worth risking on dangerous missions? Should you focus materials on specialized depth or portfolio breadth? These choices determine whether your survival strategy works.

## Expedition Operations

Survival depends on a constant cycle that's become humanity's main adaptation to this hostile world.

**Preparation Phase**: Ghosts plan expeditions into hostile territory, configuring Shells for specific mission needs. Three-person teams coordinate their arsenals to cover tactical roles: reconnaissance specialists with enhanced sensors, salvage specialists with heavy-duty systems, survival specialists with balanced capabilities.

**Exploration Phase**: Teams venture into the megastructure depths searching for resources, technology, and safe passages. Every expedition is a calculated risk where potential rewards must justify the danger of losing irreplaceable Shells. Combat happens on linear battlefields where positioning, timing, and resource management determine who lives and who dies.

**Return Phase**: Successful expeditions bring back materials and knowledge the community needs to survive. Failed expeditions mean lost Shells, depleted resources, and fewer tactical options.

**Learning Integration**: Each expedition teaches lessons that stick in your ghost consciousness. Knowledge builds over time: Shell optimization expertise, tactical awareness, team coordination skills. This makes veteran ghosts increasingly valuable as expedition partners.

**Expertise Development**: Character advancement focuses on consciousness evolution rather than gear accumulation. Each Shell destruction becomes a chance to rebuild more effectively using accumulated knowledge, experiment with new configurations, and apply tactical lessons learned. The most skilled operators are often those with extensive reconstruction experience who understand that Shell optimization is trial and error where each failure teaches something new.

## Survival Parameters

This world doesn't support heroic victories or dramatic reversals. Survival itself is an achievement against overwhelming odds. Every successful expedition, every Shell that returns intact, every day a community continues to exist is a victory.

Humanity can't defeat G.A.I.A. or reclaim the world. Communities can only carve out stable niches for continued existence. Success shows up in incremental improvements: better Shell configurations, safer routes through the megastructure, more efficient resource extraction, stronger community bonds.

The `Core`/`Shell` system explores human identity when physical form becomes disposable while consciousness stays permanent. Identity centers on consciousness quality, relationships, and accumulated experience rather than physical capabilities. Ghosts develop attachment to decision-making expertise in dangerous situations, Shell optimization mastery, relationship depth with expedition partners, and community reputation based on consciousness contributions.

**Accountability and Reputation**: Because consciousness is continuous, accountability follows the Core across Shell transitions. Tactical mistakes, breakthrough discoveries, betrayals, or heroic sacrifices accumulate in community memory tied to Core identity rather than Shell configuration. This creates real social consequences where veteran Cores who lose multiple expensive Shells through recklessness face community judgment for wasting resources.

**The Adaptation Paradox**: Humanity survives by partially accepting G.A.I.A.'s logic. Regular humans represent contamination in the artificial world, but ghosts in Shells approach acceptable infrastructure. Humanity persists by becoming more like what tried to replace them - consciousness in artificial form operating in hostile environments - while retaining the crucial difference that consciousness has inherent value independent of optimization metrics.

The ghost concept bridges human consciousness and mechanical capability, creating something greater than either component could achieve alone.
