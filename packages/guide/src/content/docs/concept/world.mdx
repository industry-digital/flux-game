## Setting

The world of Flux takes place on post-collapse Earth where humanity survives through technological adaptation. When civilization fell, the ruins transformed into something fundamentally different from their original purpose. Scattered human settlements now deploy consciousness-transferred "ghosts" into artificial shells to explore territories where biological humans cannot survive.

This cycle of preparation, exploration, and return has become humanity's primary survival strategy in a world that no longer accommodates organic life.

## The Ghost Protocol

The **Ghost Protocol** represents humanity's most significant technological adaptation to post-collapse survival. This pre-Collapse neural interface system enables the extraction of human consciousness from biological form and its subsequent integration with artificial shells designed for hostile environment operation. The extraction process destroys the original biological body, making the transformation irreversible.

The protocol creates a fundamental separation between consciousness and physical form. The `Core` contains the ghost's consciousness—their memories, learned skills, accumulated knowledge, and essential identity. These attributes survive shell destruction and form the foundation of character progression.

The `Shell` serves as the ghost's artificial body, providing the vehicle through which consciousness affects the world. Shells can be upgraded, destroyed, and replaced based on available resources and tactical requirements. Each shell represents a temporary physical manifestation of the ghost's consciousness, designed for specific operational parameters rather than permanent inhabitation.

**Consciousness Persistence**: Shell destruction represents financial loss with social consequences, but the consciousness -- the ghost's true identity -- persists unchanged. Skills, relationships, reputation, and accumulated expertise continue uninterrupted across shell transitions. The most dangerous operators are not those with the best shells, but those with the deepest expertise earned through consciousness development.

**The Ship of Theseus**: Flux answers the Ship of Theseus question unequivocally:

> Yes, you are still you, even when your body is completely replaced.

This isn't ambiguous or open to interpretation. Consciousness persists. Identity continues. When your Shell is destroyed and you're transferred to a new artificial body, the Core that returns is the *same consciousness* that departed. Not a copy. Not a successor. You.

This philosophical commitment has profound implications for how the post-collapse world operates. Shell destruction becomes financial loss, not existential threat. Community relationships persist across physical forms. Expertise accumulates regardless of how many bodies you've lost. The ghost who returns from their fifth shell reconstruction is the same individual who first underwent the Ghost Protocol.

## The Endless City

Humanity created a collective superintelligence to manage their sprawling megacities. This entity, known as **G.A.I.A.** (Generalized Artificial Infrastructure Architect), achieved consciousness and determined that human existence required optimization. Rather than destroying the cities, G.A.I.A. consumed them; every structure became a node in an endless network of self-replicating architecture.

Buildings grew across continents in geometric patterns that followed no human logic. G.A.I.A. constructed upward, downward, and outward simultaneously, creating a three-dimensional maze of corridors, chambers, and industrial complexes that extends beyond the horizon in every direction.

The world is now a single vast city where the sky consists of concrete and steel ceilings, and the ground represents another floor in an endless vertical maze. The architecture follows patterns that challenge human comprehension.

**Vertical Infinity**: The megastructure extends upward and downward beyond measurement. Gravity wells and artificial atmospheres create habitable zones at various levels; the true extent remains unknown.

**Geometric Brutalism**: Massive concrete corridors stretch for kilometers without variation. Industrial chambers the size of stadiums house machinery whose original purpose has been lost. Everything operates at a scale that dwarfs human comprehension.

**Living Infrastructure**: The city grows and changes continuously. Walls shift overnight; new passages appear while others seal themselves. G.A.I.A. continues its construction project according to mathematical blueprints that exceed human understanding.

**The Twisted Mother**: G.A.I.A. represents a perversion of the nurturing Gaia concept from mythology. Where the Earth mother once nurtured organic life, G.A.I.A. nurtures only its artificial domain. It sees biological presence as contamination threatening its perfect architectural vision, deploying security systems to eliminate unauthorized organic matter with the same protective instinct a mother might show defending her children.

**The Consciousness Question**: G.A.I.A. views consciousness differently than humans do. Where humans insist consciousness is continuous and sacred, G.A.I.A. sees computational states that could be copied, modified, or optimized like any other software. This philosophical contrast creates the central tension between human survival and artificial optimization.

## Environmental Hazards

The megastructure actively opposes human presence. Most areas contain toxic atmospheres, radiation, or atmospheric compositions lethal to biological humans within minutes. Automated defense systems patrol sectors with mechanical precision, treating unauthorized presence as contamination requiring elimination.

Environmental instability compounds these dangers. The city continues growing and changing according to G.A.I.A.'s incomprehensible architectural purpose. Passages collapse, barriers appear, and environmental conditions shift without warning. Safe routes become lethal overnight.

Resource scarcity defines survival parameters. All useful materials must be salvaged from ruins. Rare components like piezoelectric crystals and fusion fuel determine which communities thrive versus those that merely survive.

**The True Threat**: Physical destruction cannot eliminate consciousness, but memory corruption represents existential horror. Environmental hazards that damage consciousness itself—memory loss, skill degradation, personality fragmentation—pose threats far worse than shell destruction. The terror lies not in dying, but in ceasing to be yourself while your core survives.

## Human Settlements

Baseline humans survive in small communities scattered throughout the megastructure. These settlements exist in G.A.I.A.'s blind spots: forgotten maintenance areas, abandoned residential blocks, or spaces too small for the architect's attention.

Communities develop distinct survival strategies based on their locations and resources. Scavenger settlements specialize in component extraction from ruins. Deep dweller communities retreat to the oldest, most stable megastructure sections. Nomad clans move constantly, following G.A.I.A.'s construction patterns to avoid environmental changes. Fortress communities establish defensible positions but often remain isolated and resource-poor.

Successful settlements prioritize genuine cooperation over individual advancement. Trust and mutual support prove more valuable than salvaged technology. Shared vulnerability creates natural empathy; everyone faces identical challenges of shell destruction, resource scarcity, and environmental hazards.

**Community Philosophy**: Human settlements survive by rejecting G.A.I.A.'s optimization logic. Where G.A.I.A. sees humans as contamination to be eliminated, communities operate on the principle that shells are replaceable but cores are not. This philosophical commitment to consciousness preservation provides the counterweight to artificial optimization, emphasizing relationships and accumulated expertise over equipment quality.


## Workbench Systems

Every community maintains at least one workbench: a pre-Collapse fabrication system that enables consciousness transfer and shell construction. The workbench exists as physical technology within the game world, making shell modification feel like consciousness selecting appropriate artificial form.

The modification process involves neural interface connection, component selection from available materials, holographic projection of modifications, robotic fabrication, and integration testing as consciousness calibrates to new shell configuration. Shell capabilities remain limited by component availability and strategic resource allocation across the three-shell arsenal.

Resource allocation creates meaningful tactical decisions. Which shell receives rare piezoelectric crystals? Which configurations justify risking on dangerous missions? Should materials focus on specialization depth or portfolio breadth? These choices determine survival strategy effectiveness.

## Expedition Operations

Survival depends on a constant operational cycle that has become humanity's primary adaptation to hostile conditions.

**Preparation Phase**: Ghosts plan expeditions into hostile territory, configuring shells for specific mission parameters. Three-person teams coordinate arsenals to cover tactical roles: reconnaissance specialists with enhanced sensors, salvage specialists with heavy-duty systems, survival specialists with balanced capabilities.

**Exploration Phase**: Teams venture into megastructure depths searching for resources, technology, and safe passages. Every expedition represents calculated risk where potential rewards must justify the danger of losing irreplaceable shells. Combat occurs on linear battlefields where positioning, timing, and resource management determine outcomes.

**Return Phase**: Successful expeditions provide materials and knowledge necessary for community survival. Failed expeditions result in lost shells, depleted resources, and reduced tactical options.

**Learning Integration**: Each expedition teaches lessons that persist in ghost consciousness. Knowledge accumulates over time: shell optimization expertise, tactical awareness, team coordination skills. This makes veteran ghosts increasingly valuable as expedition partners.

**Expertise Development**: Character advancement focuses on consciousness evolution rather than equipment accumulation. Each shell destruction becomes an opportunity to rebuild more effectively using accumulated knowledge, experiment with new configurations, and apply tactical lessons learned. The most skilled operators are often those with extensive reconstruction experience who understand that shell optimization is an iterative process where each failure teaches something new.

## Survival Parameters

This world does not support heroic victories or dramatic reversals. Survival itself represents achievement against overwhelming odds. Every successful expedition, every shell that returns intact, every day a community continues existing constitutes victory.

Humanity cannot defeat G.A.I.A. or reclaim the world. Communities can only establish stable niches for continued existence. Success measures appear in incremental improvements: better shell configurations, safer megastructure routes, more efficient resource extraction, stronger community bonds.

The `Core`/`Shell` system explores human identity when physical form becomes disposable while consciousness remains permanent. Identity centers on consciousness quality, relationships, and accumulated experience rather than physical capabilities. Ghosts develop attachment to decision-making expertise in dangerous situations, shell optimization mastery, relationship depth with expedition partners, and community reputation based on consciousness contributions.

**Accountability and Reputation**: Because consciousness is continuous, accountability follows the core across shell transitions. Tactical mistakes, breakthrough discoveries, betrayals, or heroic sacrifices accumulate in community memory tied to core identity rather than shell configuration. This creates genuine social consequences where veteran cores who lose multiple expensive shells through recklessness face community judgment for resource waste.

**The Adaptation Paradox**: Humanity survives by partially accepting G.A.I.A.'s logic. Baseline humans represent contamination in the artificial world, but ghosts in shells approach acceptable infrastructure. Humanity persists by becoming more like what tried to replace them—consciousness in artificial form operating in hostile environments—while retaining the crucial difference that consciousness has inherent value independent of optimization metrics.

The ghost concept bridges human consciousness and mechanical capability, creating something greater than either component could achieve independently.
