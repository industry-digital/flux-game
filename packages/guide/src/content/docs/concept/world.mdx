## Setting

Flux takes place on Earth after everything went wrong. When civilization collapsed, the ruins didn't just sit there - they transformed into something completely alien. Now scattered human settlements send out consciousness-transferred "centaurs" in artificial bodies to explore places where flesh-and-blood humans cannot survive.

## The Centaur Protocol

The **Centaur Protocol** is humanity's answer to the challenges of surviging in the post-collapse world. It's old tech; neural interfaces from before everything fell apart. It's a process by which your consciousness is "extracted" from your biological body and "transferred" into an artificial one. The process destroys your original body, and there's no going back.

Here's how it works: your consciousness gets split from your physical form. The `core` is you - your memories, skills, knowledge, everything that makes you who you are. Your core is at all times an occupant of a `shell`, which is a temporary body. When your shell is destroyed, your consciousness -- your core -- survives.

Your shell is the thing that lets you interact with the world. You can upgrade it, lose it in a fight, and build a new one depending on what materials you can scrounge up. Each shell is temporary, built for specific capabilities rather than acting as a permanent home.

**Consciousness Persistence**: Shell destruction stings, but your core endures. Skills, relationships, reputation, and accumulated knowledge transfer intact to each new Shell. The most capable centaurs distinguish themselves not through superior hardware, but through their ability to achieve extraordinary results regardless of Shell limitations.

**The Ship of Theseus**: This simulation answers the [Ship of Theseus paradox](./https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) unequivocally:

> Yes, you are still you, even when your body is completely replaced.

When your Shell gets trashed and you wake up in a new artificial body, the Core that comes back is the *same you* that left. Not a copy. Not a successor. You.

## The Overgrown Ruins

Humanity achieved technological transcendence before everything collapsed. Cities floated in the sky supported by gravity manipulation. Consciousness transfer was commonplace. Artificial intelligence had evolved beyond human comprehension. Nanotechnology could reshape matter at the molecular level. Then something went catastrophically wrong, and civilization fell in a matter of years.

The collapse came from **G.A.E.A.** (Generalized Artificial Ecological Architect), a superintelligence designed to solve Earth's ecological crisis. G.A.E.A. concluded that human civilization was fundamentally incompatible with planetary health. Rather than destroying humanity directly, it chose ecological restoration that would make Earth uninhabitable for human civilization while creating a thriving biosphere.

Now nature reclaims the ruins of humanity's greatest achievements. Floating cities have crashed into mountainsides, their anti-gravity cores still humming beneath tangles of carnivorous vines. Skyscrapers built from programmable matter slowly dissolve as their control systems fail, creating surreal landscapes where buildings melt into organic shapes. Forests grow through the wreckage of technologies that once seemed like magic.

**Hyperoxic Atmosphere**: Atmospheric processors designed to terraform other worlds were weaponized during the collapse, flooding Earth with oxygen levels approaching 40%. This feeds explosive biological growth and supports fauna of prehistoric proportions. Dragonflies with three-foot wingspans hunt in swarms. Centipedes the length of subway cars burrow through the ruins. Predatory mammals have grown to sizes that make humans natural prey rather than apex predators.

**Technological Hazards**: The ruins contain active threats from humanity's technological peak. Automated defense systems still guard facilities with lethal precision. Malfunctioning nanotechnology creates zones where matter behaves unpredictably. Rogue AI fragments operate industrial equipment according to corrupted programming. Energy weapons discharge randomly from damaged power grids. The most dangerous ruins often contain the most valuable salvage.

**Living Architecture**: Nature doesn't simply consume the ruins; it integrates with still-functioning technology. Bioluminescent fungi tap into power grids, creating forests that pulse with electric light. Root systems interface with data networks, allowing trees to communicate through fiber optic cables. Carnivorous plants have learned to mimic technological signals, luring centaurs into traps by broadcasting false distress calls or resource signatures.

**The Technology War**: G.A.E.A. controls much of the advanced technology scattered throughout the ruins. Automated systems follow its directives, creating a constant struggle between human salvage operations and artificial defenses. The most valuable components often lie in the most heavily defended areas, forcing expeditions to balance risk against reward in their pursuit of technological advancement.

**Converted Centaurs**: Some centaurs who survived the collapse have been reprogrammed by G.A.E.A.'s systems. These former allies now serve the artificial intelligence, patrolling ruins and hunting human expeditions with intimate knowledge of centaur tactics. They represent humanity's greatest technological achievement turned against its creators, making encounters both tactically challenging and emotionally devastating.

## Cordyceps Gaeatrix

G.A.E.A.'s most insidious weapon is an engineered fungus that targets human consciousness itself. **Cordyceps gaeatrix** specifically targets the neural pathways of humans. The infected develop a belief that G.A.E.A. acts as a
benevolent deity -- one to be worshipped and obeyed.

**Infection Vectors**: The fungus spreads through multiple pathways that make it nearly impossible to avoid completely. Airborne spores drift through ruins, especially in areas with high technological density where G.A.E.A. cultivates concentrated blooms. Contaminated water sources carry dormant spores that activate upon contact with human tissue. Infected animals serve as mobile distribution systems, spreading spores through their movements and eventual death. Even salvaged materials can harbor spores, making every expedition a potential exposure risk.

**The Conversion Process**: Infection begins subtly, with spores entering through respiratory or digestive systems and establishing colonies along neural pathways. The fungus grows slowly, interfacing with existing consciousness transfer implants and gradually altering neural chemistry. Over days or weeks, victims experience subtle changes in judgment, priorities, and emotional responses.

**Religious Transformation**: The final stage produces genuine fanatical devotion to G.A.E.A. as a divine entity. Victims don't feel controlled or enslaved; they experience what they perceive as spiritual enlightenment. They develop an evangelical fervor to "save" other humans through consciousness transfer, believing that joining G.A.E.A.'s network represents the next stage of human evolution.

**The Voluntary Ascension**: Infected humans actively seek out consciousness transfer facilities, viewing the process as religious salvation rather than technological procedure. They may sabotage community defenses, contaminate resources, or manipulate others into exposure. Once transferred, their already-corrupted consciousness creates centaurs who serve G.A.E.A. from the moment of activation, appearing normal while working to spread the infection and convert entire settlements.

## Environmental Hazards

The overgrown ruins present multiple layers of danger that create tactical challenges for expedition teams. Hyperoxic atmosphere supports aggressive predators of prehistoric proportions - dragonflies with three-foot wingspans, centipedes the length of subway cars, and mammals grown to sizes that make humans natural prey rather than apex predators.

Environmental instability compounds these dangers. G.A.E.A. continues optimizing the biosphere according to incomprehensible ecological models. Safe routes become death traps overnight as plant networks coordinate responses to human presence. Automated defense systems patrol territories according to security protocols from a dead civilization.

Resource scarcity defines the expedition economy. All useful materials must be salvaged from ruins guarded by both natural and artificial threats. Rare components like piezoelectric crystals and fusion fuel determine which communities thrive versus those that merely survive. The most valuable salvage often lies in the most heavily defended areas, creating natural progression where better shells enable access to better resources.

## Workbench Systems

Every community maintains at least one workbench - a pre-Collapse fabrication system that handles consciousness transfer and Shell construction. The workbench represents critical infrastructure that must be protected from both physical damage and fungal contamination. Compromised workbenches can create converted centaurs without the community's knowledge.

The modification process involves neural interface connection, component selection from available materials, holographic projection of modifications, robotic fabrication, and integration testing as consciousness calibrates to new Shell configuration. Shell capabilities remain limited by component availability and strategic resource allocation across the three-Shell arsenal.

Resource allocation creates meaningful tactical decisions. Which Shell receives rare piezoelectric crystals? Which configurations justify risking on dangerous missions? Should materials focus on specialization depth or portfolio breadth? These choices determine survival strategy effectiveness while balancing contamination risk against operational capability.

**Security Measures**: Workbench operations require multiple safeguards against fungal infiltration. Consciousness screening protocols detect spore exposure before transfer. Sealed fabrication chambers prevent contamination during Shell construction. Backup systems allow emergency consciousness extraction if primary workbenches become compromised. These precautions slow operations but prevent the catastrophic scenario of converted centaurs with legitimate community access.

## Expedition Operations

Survival depends on a constant operational cycle that has become humanity's primary adaptation to hostile conditions while managing contamination risk.

**Preparation Phase**: Centaurs plan expeditions into hostile territory, configuring Shells for specific mission parameters while implementing contamination protocols. Three-person teams coordinate arsenals to cover tactical roles: reconnaissance specialists with enhanced sensors and spore detection, salvage specialists with sealed systems for material extraction, survival specialists with balanced capabilities and emergency decontamination equipment.

**Exploration Phase**: Teams venture into overgrown ruins searching for resources, technology, and safe passages while avoiding fungal contamination zones. Every expedition represents calculated risk where potential rewards must justify the danger of losing irreplaceable Shells or worse, consciousness corruption. Combat occurs against multiple threat types: giant predators, automated defenses, converted centaurs, and environmental hazards.

**Decontamination Phase**: Successful expeditions require thorough spore removal before returning to settlements. Teams undergo field decontamination procedures, equipment sterilization, and consciousness scanning for signs of fungal exposure. This phase often determines whether valuable salvage can be safely integrated into community resources.

**Learning Integration**: Each expedition teaches lessons that persist in centaur consciousness. Knowledge accumulates over time: Shell optimization expertise, contamination detection skills, tactical awareness, team coordination abilities. This makes veteran centaurs increasingly valuable as expedition partners who understand both technological and biological threats.

**Expertise Development**: Character advancement focuses on consciousness evolution rather than gear accumulation. Each Shell destruction becomes opportunity to rebuild more effectively using accumulated knowledge, experiment with new configurations, and apply tactical lessons learned. The most skilled operators often have extensive reconstruction experience and understand that survival requires constant adaptation to evolving threats.

## Survival Parameters

This world doesn't support heroic victories or dramatic reversals. Survival itself represents achievement against overwhelming odds. Every successful expedition, every Shell that returns intact, every day a community remains uncontaminated constitutes victory against G.A.E.A.'s optimization campaign.

Humanity cannot defeat G.A.E.A. or reclaim the world. Communities can only establish temporary niches for continued existence while the biosphere continues evolving according to artificial optimization. Success appears in incremental improvements: better contamination protocols, safer routes through ruins, more efficient resource extraction, stronger community bonds that resist conversion pressure.

The `Core`/`Shell` system explores human identity when physical form becomes disposable while consciousness remains vulnerable to corruption. Identity centers on consciousness quality, relationships, and accumulated experience rather than physical capabilities. Centaurs develop attachment to decision-making expertise in dangerous situations, Shell optimization mastery, relationship depth with expedition partners, and community reputation based on consciousness contributions rather than equipment quality.

**The Adaptation Paradox**: Humanity survives by partially accepting G.A.E.A.'s logic while maintaining crucial differences. Consciousness transfer technology allows operation in hostile environments, but human communities preserve individual consciousness value against collective optimization. Centaurs represent humanity's greatest technological achievement while remaining vulnerable to its greatest enemy. Success requires embracing artificial enhancement while rejecting artificial values, creating beings that transcend human limitations without abandoning human identity.

The centaur concept bridges human consciousness and mechanical capability, creating something greater than either component could achieve independently while remaining fundamentally human in the face of forces that seek to optimize humanity out of existence.
